I hire a lot of people to courier these things, but no one gets to transport a package the whole way. Not very safe to do that. Your job is to pick up any packages you spot and bring them back to me. If you bring enough packages, I'll give you free stuff.$NL;$NL;There are 5 types of packages, color coded by value: Green Mantis, Yellow Bull, Red Spider, Blue Eagle, and Purple Snake. Green is basic stuff, purple is highly desirable goods. You get the idea.$NL;$NL;When you spot a package, just approach it and pick it up. You get them at the end of each day. The entire team gets the package count, so there's no need to ninja loot from your team mates. Once you earn enough packages of a specific color, the rewards will be automatically added to your inventory, free of charge. You get one each of all mods in the reward package. Check the package pages for details.$NL;$NL;After completing a package, feel free to start collecting again: You'll keep earning more rewards as long as you bring home packages. Happy hunting.$NL;$NL;- Gage.",
