This person then bought his way onto the famous Shacklethorne expedition bound for Antarctica. His presence, according to the Elephant, doomed the voyage from the start. The familiarity of this is not a coincidence, despite the Elephant's caginess. The ship and crew were lost, until recently, when the wreckage was found crushed in the ice, far from the original planned route. A couple of miles from the wreckage, they also found a mummified corpse who looks to have died rather horrifically, and a sled along with a collection of artifacts. The items recovered are going to be auctioned in secret to a bunch of decadent society types, and the Elephant says that one of those items will help us with the device in the kitchen. I have a strange feeling about this one. It hits rather close to home."

Jiu Feng has an insider working as a barman, and has arranged to help us with gear and intel on shipboard operations. We know that they have put Xun Kang, the piece of kak who tortured Vlad, on the ship because the triad is extra vulnerable and he's one of their best. We also know the casino onboard is being run by a dwankie named Li Deng, who is apparently a bit of a boisterous buffoon and not held in high regard within the Golden Dagger. Both of them likely share security clearance. Once you're on the ship, you will need to conduct a tight operation because the coast guard is patrolling the area and they'll have kerels onboard before you can say "Look, a blerrie swimming badger!", so no messing around, yeah?"

"pln_nmh_90_02","This is crazy, the hospital is surrounded. Looks like private military... mercenaries. You gotta go... NOW."
"loc_chca_084_03","There's no way the Golden Dwankies will recover from this."

"pln_spa_27_01","You'll need a crowbar to get those elevator doors open!"
"plt_flt_01_01","OK, I'm in the area, but the cops got snipers on the roofs all around the building. You need to get rid of those before I can drop the C4."
"e352aa9aa1b8da48","Sure as shit. He figured out which of the ranch hands was Gemma's insider, messed him up 'til he spilled the beans. You heard Rainey's voicemail. Gabriel wants nothing more than to take y'all on."

"brs_pt2_03_11","I don't think this trash can has been emptied since Bush was in power. Bush senior!"
"loc_trai_52_02","Break into the admin office!"
"pln_ca1_135_03","How much did you win? Can we all retire?"
"mc1_fwb_02_06","What if I come back? And bring salsa!"
"loc_fex_44_01","Kerels stopped the device. Get back and rearm it!"
"dr1_a01c_any_06","These are some determined fucking law enforcers!"
"pln_fish_31_02","We almost had it!"
"loc_tag_49_07","C'mon friends, get to those lights."
"pln_fj1_cnc_01_02","There is a jewelry store downtown that just recieved a shipment. You up for a smash and grab?"
"loc_chca_076_01","That was it, nicely done. The vault should be unprotected so you can resume the hack."
"loc_chca_052_01","We know the vault is controlled by Yufu Wang's two top men. Li Deng has the code, and you need Xun Kang's handprint as well."
"loc_brb_39_02","...Now start up the winch. And keep the coppers away from it!"
"pln_ko1_20_01","That's the first one, guys. Keep working."
"rb5_hb1_03_05","Some shitbag ratted on me. Dunno who, but I am sure."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_02_any_02","Look, people! Get your shit together and get those bags secured before the cops do. The pick-up boat is on the way."
"pln_bigoil_stage1_end_b_02","We got the address - problem is we did not get any intel. This means we are coming in hard and with no info on what to expect. Time is ticking - let's get up the mountains and steal this engine. "
"dr2_a19_any_01","That's six!"
"loc_trai_31_02","Last thing we need to do is rotate that turntable. Find the controls, and keep an eye out for any workers in the vicinity. If the system needs an access card, they'll have one."
"loc_des_08_02","All projects run here are temporary, so a lot has changed."
"pln_nightclub_stage1_09_any_01","Guys, we need to get that safe open."
"loc_mex_70_02","Good, we got what we need. Murkywater and the Dentist will be in big trouble once this hits home."
"loc_tag_65_04","Don't stay around longer than you have to... just take it and get out, yeah?"
"pyr_al1_10_05","Hands off dicks, hands on button. Now!"
"lt1_pa_01_01","What the fuck!? Police!"
"loc_chca_intro_01_05","I don't know! We're just sitting here waiting. I was just making conversation."
"loc_chca_intro_loud_05_06","What, he knows my brother-in-law?"
"drv_watchdogs_stage1_13_any_01","I'm off in 30!"
"loc_brb_26_01","How are you coming along with that drill, friends?"
"pln_hm1_66_01","Neighbors must've heard gunshots. Police signals just went nuts."
"pln_sh21_10_02","The SWAT-team is here! Dallas, you need to take 'em out!"
"loc_pent_45_02","Some insider friends have left the tools we need in a van. Go get them and head for the elevator shaft."
"pln_hb2_18_01","Gas, watch out! Wait for it to dissipate!"
"loc_bex_101_03","The gas should be gone in a minute."
"loc_chas_84_03","Hurry up and get that statue out of there!"
"fdf43a784fa4060e","First thing we need to do is access the server room. We've got intel saying that an office worker has the keycard."
"pln_cr2_21_01","Nice! Comm frequencies for the Moretta. This will be useful later on, but stay focused."
"c5523264980b970d","Blerrie phone! If we don't want anyone checking in, we should answer it."
"geo_glc_04_01","Shit, I missed. I'll come around and make another attempt. Hold out for another minute or so!"
"loc_fex_40f_03","The wine cellar door - open it with the code, yeah?"
"pln_cr2_95_01","Guys! Get to the boat!"
"loc_mex_cook_11_09","...that's my very best guess."
"dr2_a65_any_02","Under fire! UNDER FIRE!"
"loc_mex_52_02","According to Rust, these biker keks keep lots of breaching charges around. "

"loc_sand_66_01","Guys, Vlad is not looking too stable, just hang in there until Jiu Feng arrives."
"loc_mex_56_02","You gotta blow that door. "
"lt1_aes_01_02","Who let them in, eh? What the fuck!?"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_72_any_02","They have tactical units here."
"loc_bph_36_01","Hurry, friends!"
"be1_fwb_02_03","Oh....Uh, yeah. Well, I guess that would be...prudent."
"alm_pda9_11_03","That Piggy Bank is ready to blow!"
"pln_hb1_17_01","It's done. Now hit the button, and lower the bollards."
"pln_rt1_j_07","...for sure. Or, most likely."
"be1_fwb_02_01","Uh....that's great. Yeah, I might do a bit like that too."
"mrp_rvd_07_08","Wish I were at a burger joint with my girl right now."
"pln_rats_stage1_29_any_01","Get the bags to the van to secure them. Don't let the cops run away with your hard earned meth!"
"pln_pal_36_04","Get the water hose laid out all the way down to the safe."
"loc_des_68_07","Activate the charge cycle, yeah?"
"pln_nmh_46_01","He's got some serious condition... and we need his blood."
"dr2_a01d_any_18","Sit tight, it's gonna get rough!"
"pln_tr1b_03_03","The shells are tucked away. Nice work, I'm sending your getaway."
"loc_des_71_03","Something interrupted the charge cycle. You have to restart it."
"bik2_se_01_01","I got one!"
"dlg_pln_bb1_intro_01_01","Security here is tight. We might be able to do this heist silently. But if things go loud, don't worry. I've always got a Plan B."
"loc_pent_75_01","Your extraction is ready. Get out of here as soon as you've finished up."
"pln_ed3_07_01","Think it's almost there... Hang on... Wait... fuck! It crashed again. Get it rebooted."
"pln_dah_09_01","First router has been hacked."
"loc_chca_intro_02_02","We're here for the cash, you chop. There's no time for cutting off any noses."
"pln_cs1_107_02","Vault keycard. It gets half the job done. Swipe it in the reader, and then track down the second card."
"loc_bex_75_04","Still too much blocking the square, get it cleared!"
"loc_brb_19_01","More coppers are going to arrive unless you shut that alarm off."
"pln_branchbank_cash_stage1_brief_02b","The manager might have a key too. I'd wish you luck, but you don't need it, right? "
"loc_ranc_56A_01","We need to find a way over to the workshop."
"plt_a02_any_07","Bile to the rescue!"
"loc_sah_79_01","What are you waiting for? The vault is open."
"pln_cr2_02_02","Good work. Just need to find one more keycard."
"1ad9807e62b48845","The saw's been tampered with!"
"loc_chas_19_01","Check the other areas and see if there's something you can use."
"pln_tr1_28_02","They're using C4 to blast those doors. Guess they don't know about all the live ammo that train is carrying."
"pln_branchbank_regular_a_intro_a_02","Who's ready to do a bank job? I know I am."
"cha_spa_18_01","They got me. But it's ok, just a minor flesh wound."
"pln_cs1_93_03","This heist will go down in legend. I'm already writing the wiki entry. It starts with 'Holy crap!'"
"loc_bex_44_01a","I'm almost afraid to ask..."
"bik2_pa_01_02","What the hell! It's the cops!"
"loc_jr2_12_03","Don't stop looking, you kaks. I tell you the pallet is there somewhere."
"pln_sh12_10_01","Damn! Incoming security guard outside! Deal with him before he sees the broken camera and triggers the alarm!"
"pln_moon_13_02","Get those shoes!"
"dr2_a07a_any_03","Alright, I'm at the spot!"
"loc_sah_100_02","Cut through there with that nice blowtorch you found."
"bik1_gc_01_19","You're dead!"
"plt_al1_01_06","Can't hang around here, gang. Get the money in the box."
"pln_dn1_22_01","Gang, we need that firetrap by our escape. Use the crane controls."
"pln_fish_14_02","Either secure the bags in the motorboat, or chuck them in the sea. We can pick them up as we leave."
"bos_fri_03_08","My caaaar!!"
"pln_hm1_78_02","Surely there has to be a way to open the crates. A crowbar or something. "
"ict2_sfa_01_01","Ey man, over here!"
"loc_mex_cook_08_07","It should be acid."
"drv_watchdogs_stage1_20_any_01","All of them? Hector loves detail-oriented motherfuckers."
"loc_ranc_24_02","The gate's locked with an RFID tag. If we want to pass through, we'll need to get a look at the wiring in that box."
"loc_fex_22_02","See if you can find Buluc's secret meeting room. The solution for getting into his office should be there."
"mch_pal_03_04","We're gonna sail around the world, you see the boat over there? You know...put out a mill for it and, uh, I dunno... Maybe we'll put it to sea this year. Huh, we'll see."
"pln_gen_lkgo_01_14","Things are looking very good for now."
"pln_bo2_37_any_01","OK, chopper's coming in, get the prototype ready."
"loc_trai_42_02","They're making a run for it! Don't let those trains escape! "
"pln_cs1_78_02","You'll stand a good chance if some guys provide cover, while others work on those boxes."
"rt1_hm2_09_02","Is it true what they are saying about the contractor? The Croat sniper?"
"pln_sh_int_08_01","My accomplice will assist you. He's waiting."
"gus_preplan_10_01","Their computer systems will be vulnerable to this."
"pln_rvd_37_03","C'mon guys, get that liquid nitrogen."
"pln_fri_07_01","Okay, I'm trying to hack the security system now..."
"loc_trai_75_03","Turn on the engine! No point hanging around!"
"pln_dah_21_03","Look right outside the Glitter Room for one of the PCs. "
"pln_rt1_06_any_01","Get into the house."
"pln_chw_21_02","Damn, the door must be locked from the outside. Maybe there's another way out."
"pln_as1_13_03","Light the flare, gang. Pilot is blind without it."
"pln_run_24_02","You gotta clear the area of cops or Bile won't be able to get close!"
"pt1_cr3_03_03","I'm dry, and I'm outta here."
"pln_ca1_138_02","This is reception. Remember where it is."
"pln_election_stage2_end_a_01","Well done. All the machines are reconfigured. The Elephant is going to get an uncharacteristically strong showing in this district. "
"loc_chca_028_03","Deng should be feeling the effects of the barman's drug by now. Unless you feel like drilling, get the key off him."
"pln_moon_23_02","Throw the loot into the tree!"
"58bb1094a637aed1","You got a blerrie death wish?! Back to the boat!"
"plt_pt2_21_02","Okay, package is on the floor."
"pln_bo2_34_any_03","Shit this is top science stuff - use those brains - any color code, chemicals or such can be a clue."
"mrb_rvd1_12_03","'Course I brought it. Cabots don't hire morons."
"pln_at1_dow_01_01","Well, no turning back now! That was a hell of a bang! Get into that truck and do your part of the job!"
"pln_dah_cbf_01","On the 22nd floor of the Garnet Group Building, owned by Nathan Garnet, there's a safe with millions worth of diamonds. The building has high-tech security and trigger-happy guards but luckily for us there's a birthday party going on to keep them distracted. "
"pln_rat_stage3_intro_a_02","OK, the chopper's coming over the convoy now, we're on a bridge - well done Alex... For once... Hit 'em and finish it. The money's ours no matter what. Get it done."
"bik1_aes_01_10","Fuck ME!"
"loc_sah_35_03","Great, now get back and get through that door, yeah?"
"bnc_nightclub_stage1_03_any_02","I feel like I know you from somewhere. Post office? Come in."
"pln_pt2_13_02","Crew, you copy that? Pilot is inbound. Protect the goats."
"loc_brb_45_02","Put all the loot you find somewhere close, so you can collect it later, yeah?"
"pln_ca1_87_01","Haha, it worked! The guards in security are sleeping like babies. Don't worry about cameras now."
"cop_rvd_01_01","Hey man, I just follow orders! I don't know nothin'!"
"pln_ch1_32_01","Drive through the hole on the street!"
"ict1_do_01_01","I've had it with these guys man!"
"pln_fost_cam_01_01","They have cameras, take 'em out."
"140934bdbf473fa5","We can access the rig from the emergency dock!"
"pln_fwb_37_04","Go pick up the drill and thermite. It's hidden inside the copy machine."
"pln_rt1_24_any_02","Caustic chloride. Says it is some solid form... Wait a... Should be that hydrogen, right? "
"loc_count_gen_10_01","Just one more and you're done, yeah?"
"loc_ranc_33_03","An alarm got tripped! Shut it down!"
"pln_cr2_44_02","A keycard, but no damn good right now. Alarm's been sounded. Stay focused on the task."
"loc_pent_59_02","Our inside man has hidden gasoline and the gear we need in the trunk. Fuel her up and jack up the back wheels."
"loc_mex_34_01","Ach, the pump again. Donnerse thing needs more gas."
"loc_sand_60_01","Friends? Friends? Do you read? Blerrie, what was that? Nevermind..."
"pln_ch1_23_03","Now burn some rubber!"
"pln_at1_gen_20_02","This is interesting. Military blueprints in a GenSec transport. I'll look into it."
"bos_fri_06_07","You can't touch me! I got protection!"
"loc_ranc_16_03","Excellent! Now, connect me to the laptop. I can pull the intel Gemma needs, no problem."
"mch_pal_06_02","It's just down here."
"loc_pex_92_01","You need to help him get through the door."
"pln_sh12_23_03","I like the sweet sound of that! Now, leave it be for a few seconds and we should be in the clear."
"loc_brb_12_01","Get that saw off there, friends."
"gus_preplan_09_05","This will effectively reduce the number of guards on duty."
"loc_pex_22_01","That's a blerrie strong door, too tough for the drill. Better check the armory for something to open it with."
"cc95511f1e1f4836","Now, get to the lab and test the sample's purity."
"alm_pda9_04_04","That's bag number ten!"
"pln_pal_14_02","All right. Damn. Look, just pick up the phone. Let's wing this."
"pln_moon_26_03","Ok, the flare is lit. Great job guys, now just wait for Bile."
"pln_hb1_24_01","Gang, the cops have the city locked down. Fighting through is the only option, so we need you on the ground. That means the truck is going to stay with you. "
"loc_pex_65_02","Try to find something highly flammable to light this up with!"
"loc_chca_065_01","Kang is usually overlooking the casino from a meeting room. See if he's there."
"pln_cr2_33_03","Power's back. Now let's try this once more."
"bot_gen_49_any_13","I need 17 more!"
"mc1_fwb_02_01","Oh. You're sure? 'Cos I kind of spent the money already."
"gus_preplan_08_05","This will cause the surveillance system to become a lot less effective."
"lt2_count_03_01","OK, three left."
"loc_sah_67_02","Why aren't you drilling that door yet?"
"rt1_trado_02_01","The deal's off!"
"alm_pex_27_01","Gracias."
"385668037f2744b0","Hey now! Looks like Rainey used company funds to bribe folks at the EPA. Bet the FBI would find this email from her accountant very interesting."

"loc_chca_intro_03_03","What about fucking their shit up a little?"
"plt_al1_02_02","Keep throwing them bags."
"pln_hb2_04_02","The missing server is probably lying on the desk of some IT monkey. Get down there and find it."
"pln_rvd_31_02","I guess I should be surprised to see a GenSec truck out there... But those guys seem to be spreading."

"ga2_rats_stage2_05_any_01","We've got your money right here. The info is in the safe. I'll open it. No funny shit or you die."
"gem_trai_09_01","Holy shit! It can actually hold the damn thing! Ain't that a trip..."
"pln_hm1_27_03","Keep looking around the place, gang. Somewhere there's something that can help nail the Commissars exact location."
"loc_tag_04_03","Ah, blerrie. They've got those new ultra-fine detectors installed. Got to take a different approach."
"pln_cr2_60_02","Empty! Move on."
"cpt_wwh_05_01","Good, now take hose to fuel pump."
"pln_hm1_14_02","Get that C4 on the pumps at the station. Then stand back. Way back."

"mrb_rvd1_05_10","I remember the old days, when heists didn't need computers. Back then, you knew who to trust."
"loc_chca_023_03","You will likely find Xun Kang in the casino."
"pln_firestarter_stage3_end_a_01","Hector got the footage. I'm told he laughed long and hard. And now the FBI looks impossibly incompetent, which takes a lot of heat off of us. Great work."

"pln_cs1_46_01","Right. He got called in to a meeting with a big account. He's doing a great job."
"loc_chas_01_02","Alright, friends. This must be the shop we were told about. So far, the triad has been able to keep the kerels from discovering its true purpose."

"pln_glc_cbf_01","Ok, it's time to break this guy Kazuo out of prison so we can get the information he has on Kento. I engineered some ah... trouble... to get him transferred to another facility by convoy. We'll ambush that convoy and break the prisoner out. This isn't gonna be a quiet one, guys, we'll need to take extreme measures to stop the prison trucks. And, yeah, Kazuo doesn't know we're breaking him out, so boy is he in for a surprise!"
"pln_spa_intro_02","Make sure you find the target quickly. You don't know what they'll do to him."
"pln_run_08_07","Finish this once and for all!"

"loc_tag_85_03","The code begins with a four, according to my source."
"pln_al1_05_03","That was intense! All right, head back to the vault and let's finish the job. "
"pln_ed3_14_02","The vault's open. Time to see what's inside."
"pln_ca1_109_01","Damn! All right, that wasn't the vault. C4 the other spot!"

"loc_bex_26_02","Keep looking for a manual or something."
"pln_fwb_54_02","Crew! Don't lose focus. We're here for cash, and it's there for you."
"pln_bb1_36_02","That vault is tough. The drill bit broke. Get a spare part, quick!"
"pln_dah_57_02","The code has been blocked, so forget about it. Going to need another solution."
"pln_cs1_77_01","Alright. The cage is put together. But it's empty. Get it filled!"
"ict1_gc_01_33","Gonna cut you into pieces!"
"loc_chas_intro_03_02","She has been notably tight-lipped about what went on, for sure. Something about a triad from Macao?"

"loc_fex_07_01","From what we know, Buluc keeps to himself a lot, when not holding court, so you'll probably find him in his office. See if you can find it."
"loc_vit_66_03","Alright you chops, time to act nice and casual. Take off your masks and walk calmly out of there. "
"454773ab502ebfa1","There's an emergency dock at the base of the platform. Head that way."

"loc_pent_89_02","Hahaha! He's all lit up now!"
"pln_cs1_07_03","That's the cash. Remember, unless you want the cops there, get a bag over the yellow wall. Don't worry - that blackmailing asswipe will get what's coming to him."

"loc_vit_84_02","It's finished. You should be able to get through the gate, now."
"loc_bex_11_03","Well, logic would suggest he keeps the thing in his office, for sure."
"bigbank_gensec_part4_1_01","Ah, I see. Sure, that happens. OK, just try to call us beforehand next time."
"loc_des_68_02","You need to charge the cannon."
"887bd2a5c2f2acef","She's gonna blow! Get out of there!"

"pln_glc_04_08","Get to the trucks."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_13_any_02","Guys, the pick-up is near that crane."
"pln_fwb_57_01","OK, escape plan: Go up to the server room, blow up the wall and escape through the basement of the neighboring building."
"pln_as1_13_02","Gang, the pilot can't see you. You need to light that flare."
"loc_pent_44_01","You need to find that power room and rewire the fuse box."
"loc_bex_72_01","Ach, that vault is not going to open easily!"
"gsc_cs1_06_02","Hey, is everything alright over there?"
"rb4_sh11_07_02","Shit!"
"pln_ca1_48_02","Okay. The controls. Hack 'em, and keep the cops off."
"pln_pal_13_02","The police are suspicious and are calling the house. Stay put."
"loc_tag_60_03","Ah kek, not again. Maybe a midnight snack will do it. Find some food and set it outside Garrett's door."
"pln_dah_intro_01","All right, entry point. Synchronize on my mark... mark."
"rt1_se_01_02","I got one!"
"fri_dsp_radio_suspicious_1_03","Ok, but we're sending some guys over."
"pln_firestarter_stage3_brief_01","This is the place, people... This bank here holds all the Mendoza capital north of the border."

"f0468451dd68f1cb","SERA moved the carbon-capture prototype to the event room. It should still be there."

"bkl_brn_01_01","Payback!"
"loc_chca_012_01","If you can get one of those cards out of Xun Kang's cabin, I reckon I could bluff a phone call and get him out of there, yeah? See if you can find out his cabin number."

"dr2_a01b_any_04","Damn! They're right on top of us!"
"loc_des_38_03","Still waiting for that drill."
"pln_bb1_49_02","You can finish this now, or you can finish this in style, and empty the place."
"loc_chca_intro_05_04","Whatever that was, I don't think you said it right. Sounded like Hajrudin after he drank two bottles of rum that one time."
"pln_election_stage2_02_any_01","Remember the other trucks are ours! But we still want our loot back, use them to disctract the cops away from the ballot machines."

"pln_cr2_94_01","Get to the boat!"
"pln_al1_cnc_01_01","GenSec are showing their unbreakable vault at the arena. We're going to use the Alesso concert to prove them wrong."

"loc_skm_25_03","That's not how we do it! Never let them take you. This job is over."
"pln_gen_snip_02_01","More snipers are coming in!"
"bik1_do_02_04","Deal's off!"
"elp_framing_brf_speak_01","Senator Borrico is advancing in politics and business. I have learned he has made a lucrative arms deal on a national scale. This nation has paid him in pure gold."

"pln_flt_45_02","Nice work! Now it's time to get out of there before the place falls over. Let's go!"
"loc_skm_19_08","They must think we're a bunch of chops with an offer like that. I think we should make them give us more."
"pln_election_stage3_01_any_01","Remember, we're here to rob a bank. If some election equipment gets destroyed in the process, that's too bad. And it would be a real shame if the voting results became unusable somehow..."
"910d6ef2355b3226","H2!"
"pln_election_stage2_09_any_01","Good the machines are hacked, take the stuff you want from the other trucks and let's get out of here."
"loc_pent_54_01","Hurry up and find that server room. Remember, it's hidden. "
"13daed3615a0bd60","SERA was planning to unveil their carbon-capture prototype tonight. It should still be in the event room."
"loc_jr1_52_01","Damn, and shit. The aircrew are sloppy as kak. Helicopter ain't got no fuel. Hey, can you hook up the fuel line?"
"rb4_sh11_01_02","It's been what, two years? And you're making me do this shit?"
"cm1_pal_01_03","Hey, uh, my buddy has the blow. Wants 10k for it."
"loc_sah_43_02","There you go, that's the vault."
"dr2_a56_any_05","The heat's rising!"
"pln_pdsg_01_03","Keep going - this is great!"
"loc_trai_65_02","Before we do anything else, you need to fuel up our locomotive and disconnect it from the wagons."
"pln_hb3_06_01","When a door or window opens, the alarm timer will start. You'll have a limited time to disable it before it goes off."
"loc_bex_45_02","Take the winch chain and hook it to the teller window!"
"loc_chas_59_03","OK, we're going to have to drill the vault. I'm sending you one, so get outside and collect it, quickly friends!"
"pln_fri_49_02","Hey boss, got a package for you here. It's from the HQ in Bolivia."
"pln_heli_02_05","Chopper coming in - it's ours."
"bik1_aes_01_14","Who the hell are you!?"
"loc_pex_50_02","Time to go!"
"loc_chca_109_01","The helicopter can't come back for you so you'll have to risk using a lifeboat. Get over to one and lower it. We're almost done! "
"loc_vit_122_02","If you don't get me up and running, we're in serious trouble, yeah?"
"cpt_wwh_14_02","Some moorings still not removed. "
"pln_firestarter_stage3_09_any_01","OK, that's enough, get the recording and let's get out of here."
"mc1_fwb_02_07","I was hoping you'd say yes. The money could get my underwear back."

"pln_man_38_02","I can't believe I hired you again, Alex..."
"loc_chas_74_02","With any luck they'll have tools in the office, but there's a shutter door stopping you. Hack into the security system to open it."
"pln_fish_08_02","You got the first stash. Keep looking!"
"pln_pal_46_02","SWATs are coming in from the south, by the beach!"
"pln_gen_bfr_05_01","I'm sending the loot van."
"loc_ranc_55_01","When you bring the power back on, don't let the kêrels shut it off again. And keep them away from the laptop!"
"pln_as1_02_02","Vlad's very keen on talking to you on this one."
"dr1_a30_any_01","Yep, that's 17 bags!"
"pln_framing_stage1_02_any_02","Alright... OK, we need at least four paintings, remember, the ones with red stickers."
"loc_brb_cbf_01","Dear friends, we're going back to New York. Theres something buried in the foundation of the old Brooklyn Bank that Bain was after. Could be a way out of this current predicament we're in. While we're there, it might be a good idea to pick up some extra operating cash to keep us going. Replacing all of Bain's equipment isn't going to be cheap I can tell you, and the stuff I've got running as backup isn't going to hold up for long, yeah? At the moment, we're open targets."
"rt1_aes_01_09","What the FUCK!?"
"loc_ranc_26_02","There's a wire out here somewhere that we need to cut. You can check which color if you look inside the RFID box."

"loc_brb_01_01","...You got about a minute until the kerels get there. Keep those civvis under control, yeah?"
"loc_sah_39_01","Perfect, now get back to the car and get out of there."

"rt2_se_01_13","There he is!"
"pln_dah_33_01","That's the second color and number."
"pln_hb3_32_02","That scanner will need an authority, like a FBI boss. Watch for him and for God's sake don't kill him."
"loc_chca_intro_01_02","Vaguely. What about him?"
"pln_framing_stage1_06_any_02","Everything's locked down - if you want me to fix it then I need to get into the surveillance room."
"rt1_trami_02_03","These fuckers are trying to rip us off!"
"a625d3e13507bb33","Turn H1!"
"loc_tag_36_01","Maybe the code has to do with Crimenet?"
"loc_pent_01_03","Alright. This lobby has guards, cams, and metal detectors. You need to get by all that and find the elevators. Let's go!"
"ict1_tfp_01_04","I'll tell you what. We were never gonna deal with you guys! We'll take it all!"
"pln_bb1_14_01","And now we wait. Anyone have any good stories?"
"loc_tag_59_03","Brown's computer should be nearby."
"loc_sah_09_02","Nicely done, now get to the other one."
"bik2_gc_01_36","Gonna send you to the lake!"

"pln_sfr_fal_01","I'm disappointed in you, guys. You can't even defend your own home."
"loc_des_64_04","Got to get that cannon pointing right."
"pln_flt_03_01","What are you waiting for? Get inside."
"dr2_a62_any_03","I'm afraid the cops'll find me here!"
"pln_fish_11_01","That's the last stash! You got'em all!"
"crw_wwh_01_03","You must help free Captain with saw, he is behind door."
"plt_flt_09_03","All right, that should do it! Coming in."
"pln_mad_38_02","Good, the scan is under way again."
"dr1_hb1_03_01","I told you to fucking protect me! I'm getting fired at here!"
"pln_hm2_26_08","You wouldn't believe such a dump could exist in the heart of our nation."
"loc_chas_28_01","The dragon is in a crate, but they might be booby-trapped so let's find the right one. No need make a ruckus opening things that don't need opening. They probably keep a manifest in their computer system."
"loc_chas_41_02","You need to hack that card reader."
"loc_sand_intro1a_02","No worries, the van doesn't go any faster! Helps me concentrate, yeah?"
"pln_al1_cnc_01_03","Alesso is in town tonight. Going to use his concert as cover to hit GenSec at their arena."
"pln_ed1_end_b_01","You did it loud, and you did me proud. Now, let's see if all that bang-bang was worth it. Half a database is better than none, so let's see if we have anything."
"mch_pal_07_02","There. See? Fuckin' pissing all down the wall."
"btc_fri_07_01","Ernesto Sosa has a special lock system for his office, with a spoken pass phrase. But I have planned for it - I had my people sell some special cocaine to him, with a microphone recorder hidden in the package. See if you can find it."
"pln_rvd_27_01","Better hang back until the gas is gone unless you really want to risk it."
"pln_branchbank_depositbox_brf_speak_01","I got word one of the Harvest & Trustee banks just had a big run on safe deposit rentals from a teller I used to uh, speak to, socially. I think we should get into the vault and strip those boxes bare... You with me?"
"pln_ed1_10_03","Power's down. Look for the circuit box and get it back on."
"rt1_gc_01_29","Now you get paid!"
"loc_jr1_63_01","I'm hearing over the comms that they've set up a sniper ambush ahead. Watch your heads!"
"2f52f92fb12ce9d1","He's got himself an old Murky combat suit! We stopped making them because it can't block fire and bullets at the same time. You should leak some oil into a pit and heat things up!"

"pln_glc_04_02","Go find those transports."
"pln_fj1_cbf_01_01","Theres a jewelry store downtown, fairly simple target. But be ready for the heat if the alarm goes off."
"loc_pex_62_03","It's got to be in here! Don't give up!"
"ranc_intro_01_03","If he does spot us, I'd be more worried about him. We're not the "running away" type, if you catch my drift."

"pln_al1_20_03","Our last closet door, gang!"
"loc_sand_21_01","You know, I think I saw some cake in the kitchen video feed. Let's spike it with some household cleaner, then call the foreman's office extension and trick the domkop into eating it so he vomits."

"pln_ca1_55_02","There it goes. Let it do its thing."

"loc_bex_72_03","Oh, dear... that's not going to be like cracking an egg, yeah?"
"bee0504d9ae9769d","We're a keycode away from getting that prototype. It should be written down in the Marketing Lead's office."

"loc_mex_cook_02_09","Blerrie, if I read this correctly... eh..."

"loc_chas_78a_02","You can probably open the shutter door with that terminal!"
"loc_pent_18_01","You found the room. Now you just have to get into it. The code for the keypad is stashed away somewhere around here. You can go for the drill, but that risks alerting security. It's up to you."
"loc_vit_40_02","That corridor isn't short, is it. Built to take a couple nukes, it was."
"mch_pal_01_01","How I make my money? Let's just say...well, you could say I make... a lot of it"

"chca_meeting_short_03_02","Indulging in fantasy, as usual. But I have him under control."
"loc_chca_004_03","Go find your gear."
"loc_bex_74_02","But old Locke has a nice little dinges coming for you. Go out and clear the square!"
"alm_pda9_brf_01_01","Gear up, heisters! We're hunting Piggy Banks!"
"dr1_hb1_02_03","Can't move forward. What do we do?"
"bigbank_gensec_part3_05","Ah, yeah, that. The Manager was just showing the system off to his new PA. Gonna guess the time lock isn't the only thing going to get an unscheduled activation."
"ict2_sfa_01_03","Get over here!"
"cpt_wwh_12_03","We have enough diesel now."
"bik2_tra_06_06","Are you having second thoughts or what?"
"loc_bph_05_03","There you go. Now see if you can find the cell blocks."

"ict1_do_02_02","No deal, asshole!"
"bos_fri_05_20","I'll kill you!"
"loc_chca_056_01","Well, that didn't work. You need something bigger. That chandelier might do... melt one of the cables with some thermite!"
"fe1_fwb_02_07","Perhaps you should apply at the Benevolent Bank."
"bik1_aes_01_01","Are they cops? Are they fucking cops!?"
"loc_bph_29_01","Ach, I can't get to the helipad. You gotta go and extend the walkway. Find the controls."

"gem_trai_07_03","My contact says you'll have an easier time if you burn those wagons at the roof."
"loc_chas_33_02","That's a bit of gold there, for sure! Let's get you to sneaking it out of there."
"loc_chas_56_02","It's somewhere in the warehouse."
"d45029ce78f73c34","This thing's gonna put Keegan Oil on the map! We could win a Nobel Prize. Always wanted to visit Sweden. I hear they make a mean meatball."

"dr2_a01a_any_14","Sons of bitches!"
"loc_chca_087_03","Forget the lifeboats. There's a helicopter standing by in case this happened, but you need to start a fire to signal for pickup."
"dc248ceb83435193","Our insider grabbed us a tank of the oil rig's toxic emissions. If you hook it up to Gabriel's ventilation duct, we can gas the chop."

"bot_gen_57_any_04","OK, I can't stay here forever!"
"loc_bex_25_02","Hmm, I'm not familiar with that design. Must be very unusual. Have a look in the nearby utility rooms and see of you can find a schematic."
"ad990550a60a6e30","Just shake it off!"
"btc_fri_cbf_01","I have been running guns in the Caribbean for a while. It's been very profitable, but some of the old movers in the region don't approve of my presence on the local market. The Bolivian Sosa Cartel specifically.

Now they must pay. You will collect that payment, in blood."

"loc_bex_35_02","Niiiice. There we go."
"loc_bex_47_03","OK, you chops! Watch out for flying brickwork..."
"loc_bex_53_03","Friends, there must be a server room around there. Find it and we can open that gate."
"loc_bex_63_01","We don't need him to talk, just to hack."
"loc_bex_71_03","The vault's not going to open itself..."
"loc_bph_08_02","Maybe try that thermite you found before."
"loc_bph_12a_01","That's the one, right there! Now let him out."
"loc_bph_30_01","Come on, we don't have much time, extend the walkway."
"loc_brb_06_02","Not getting in that way, yeah? There's scaffolding on the outside. Should be a door on the 2nd floor you can hack through with a saw. "
"loc_brb_30_01","Thermite is done. Burned right through that nicely, yeah? Now get going with the winch."
"loc_brb_38_02","...The hook needs to go on the vault, yeah?"
"loc_chas_30_02","There, now let's open it up."
"loc_chas_57_03","Blerrie, you're going to have to drill it. OK, hang on, I'm on it."
"loc_chas_73_01","Those triad chops seem to have lots of things handy around there, maybe you can find a blowtorch or something."
"loc_chca_007_01","No time for chatting up the drunk tourists. Find the loo with the briefcase."
"loc_chca_018_03","We're going to have to lure the dwankie out of there somehow. I have an idea."
"loc_chca_024_01","From the description, that's got to be Li Deng. Nasty dwankie. He keeps a safe in his private massage room, so that's where we'll find the code."
"loc_chca_037_02","The vault!"
"loc_chca_049_01","Ok, you chops! Be quick about this. Weapons free as soon as you hit the deck. Get it done fast, because the coast guard will not take long to respond with kerels! "
"loc_chca_056_03","Ach, let's try using the chandelier. Use some thermite on one of the cables holding it."
"loc_chca_098_01","I'm sending you a winch. When it drops from the helicopter, take the parts and assemble it in the courtyard. "
"24ad99fc12534330","Alright. SERA's moved their carbon-capture prototype into the event room. Let's scope it out."
"76305cb70966fb14","This access tag goes to the R&D storage room. Hang on to it, yeah?"
"f1c93928113d5c49","The prototype's only valuable if SERA can't build another. Head to the lab, and let's see what kind of damage we can do."
"da2157ab2a03d323","Go to the wing opposite the research offices. That's where the lab should be."
"486c8aba7940970f","The lab's all ours, chops! Let's leave it worse than we found it!"
"39b18340bde31740","You hire the Payday Gang, you hire the best."
"loc_count_gen_10_02","One more to go, friends!"
"f94c1aaa2e0043d0","I love a good drill as much as the next guy, but it's a bit conspicuous. Maybe look for the keycard instead."
"75d7483152985de6","Oh-ho! That fire did the trick! Light him up again!"
"3e02e446ac413b85","And that's the end of the Santiago Brothers! Now head to the control room and kill the blowout preventer."
"9a9b6a5565a4a71d","They'll know something's wrong if you don't answer the phone!"
"9a2d209cbca5d132","And THAT is how it's done! No one blows shit up like the Payday Gang. Good job, friends. Climb aboard.                              "
"db831be0a95e6ac3","You need to get topside!"
"ab2696ec8cf30dbd","The server's on lockdown, which is blocking the rig's oil transfer system. I think it's time for a hard reboot."
"4b55fc8bead62696","Time to put our transfer into the system. The server's unlocked, but we need a USB drive to use the computers. Our intel says it should be locked in a cabinet somewhere."
"a29b3b7bf441be36","That's not it. Take another sample!"
"3bac56e9f147b9f0","While our ship's getting ready, connect the transfer pipes to the right oil tank. Pull the release lever when they're set."
"loc_des_101_02","Those guns will make smelly swiss cheese out of Bile's chopper. Take them out by hacking the control boxes."
"loc_des_24_04","You have to reconnect the power to the crane system!"
"loc_des_29_02","Heh, it's almost exactly the same as the other. Well, it's what we came for so take it and keep going."
"loc_des_46_01","That's just... strange, eh?"
"loc_des_55_01","Ah, you got it wrong. Maybe bringing hazmat suits would have been a good idea. Wait until it stops reacting, then try again."
"loc_des_62_01","Get to the weapons lab, friends."
"loc_des_74_03","Reset the power lever, quickly!"
"loc_des_77_01","You're going to have to crack open this crate too."
"loc_des_86_05","You need to kill those cannons. Reactivate the shutdown!"
"loc_des_88_03","When you're ready to leave, light up a flare and Bile will come get you."
"loc_des_96_06","Can't shoot that cannon without more juice, replace the batteries."
"loc_des_intro_03c","A little heavy on the drama there, Locke."
"loc_des_intro_04b","If they have ray guns here, I'm taking some with me."
"loc_fex_04a_01","Ok, now see about getting into the mansion itself."
"loc_fex_04b_03","Chop chop friends. Find that door."
"loc_fex_04b_04","You know, DOORS usually lead further into buildings. Unless of course, they just lead you outside, but never mind! "
"loc_fex_08_02","Have you looked upstairs for the office?"
"loc_fex_13a_03","Knowing which mask belongs to who isn't enough, you still need to find the name of the guard currently holding the keycard."
"loc_fex_18_02","There was mention of a shrine being of importance."
"loc_fex_31a_03","You gotta find the keys to the car you want. "
"loc_fex_32_03","Can't leave without the keys!"
"loc_fex_40i_01","There you go. Take it!"
"loc_fex_46_02","Heads up you chops, the dinges is about to go off!"
"loc_fex_48_01","Have you found the server room?"
"loc_fex_54_02","Maybe there's something hidden among the books in the bookshelf."
"loc_fex_55_02","The symbols in that codex! They will open the Mayan dinges. There must be more clues. Find them!"
"loc_fex_67_02","Your car is here friends! I tried to make sure Vlad's brother-in-law was sober this time, but you know how easy that is, yeah?"
"loc_fex_69_03","Bile is still waiting for that flare."
"loc_fex_70_01","Bile is on the way. Hang in there."
"loc_fex_76_01","Locked. OK, look around for clues to the code."
"loc_fex_79_04","What about that globe?"
"loc_fex_80_03","Open the garage doors, friends."
"loc_fex_84_01","Get the door open!"
"loc_fex_86_03","You're not going anywhere until you restart that saw."
"loc_fex_87_01","You need to restart the drill."
"loc_fex_88_02","You should know this by now. Drills don't start themselves. "
"loc_fex_90_02","The codex will help tell you the proper symbols and in which order they need entering."
"loc_fex_intro_04_01","Why do you keep going bossies over Bain? Look, we've got it under control, yeah?
"
"loc_jr1_01_03","Ah! My friends! Welcome to Black Ridge. It's used for, well, for now is holding loot of a significent value. Let's steal it!"
"loc_jr1_05_01","If you would be so kind as to collect the articles I have left for you."
"loc_jr1_06_02","Superb! Now, just drop the charges near the main door."
"loc_jr1_11_01","Do the words "rig the detonator to the charges" ring a bell?"
"loc_jr1_32_03","Bravo, my friends! Now, to proceed, please attach the bags to the cables in the large vertical shaft. I am at the top, and will receive them safely."
"loc_jr1_43_01","Our escape chopper is out here, but you will also see a lot of radar equipment. With this, they could follow us anywhere we could fly to. "
"loc_jr1_48_03","Remember, you must apply the C4 to each of those radars."
"loc_jr1_57_14","He bombed a school. Good riddance."
"loc_jr1_57_18","Right in the bradley, yeah."
"loc_jr1_57_19","He was my chomma. Shit happens though, right?"
"loc_jr1_57_23","Don't feel bad. He was a bad man, for sure."
"loc_jr1_58_04","Make them earn their tom tonight, yeah? For sure."
"loc_jr2_09_01","And out the door you go!"
"loc_jr2_09_03","Don't hesitate - just jump!"
"loc_jr2_20_02","That should make things easier. Say, why don't one of you guys light a flare for me too."
"loc_jr2_23_01","Ah! Yes, I see it. I'm coming in. Be ready to attach the pallets to the helicopter. And do it quickly, if that is possible. Things are hot."
"loc_jr2_24_01","Okay. Here I am. Now, if you could just affix the straps to the pallet and I can evacuate this beautiful mountain of money."
"loc_jr2_44_03","That was a fucking great job, friends. It had it all. Excitement, action - like a movie! And best of all, a happy ending. "
"loc_mex_15_01","Cameras are now disabled."
"loc_mex_17_03","You gotta get to Mexico. Hurry."
"loc_mex_24_02","The Murky contraband we're after will be money. Could be kept anywhere nearby, so you're just going to have to search for it."
"loc_mex_29_02","That will look great in the safe house if we can ever make room for it. Take it with you. "
"loc_mex_36_01","That'll keep it going for now."
"loc_mex_43_03","No need to sneak about any longer!"
"loc_mex_48_01","More leather dwankies! Take care of them."
"loc_mex_48_02","Get rid of those biker keks!"
"loc_mex_49_03","You'll probably find the tunnel if you look around outside."
"loc_mex_54_02","That looks right. Grab them and put them on the door."
"loc_mex_63_03","Thought that tunnel would never end! No time to waste, friends. Everyone knows you're there."
"loc_mex_73_01","There's gotta be something special about that thing if they keep it locked up in here. Maybe take it with you, yeah?"
"loc_mex_cook_02_08","Now you should go with..."
"loc_mex_cook_05_05","Let's try a katspoegie of hydrogen chloride."
"loc_mex_cook_07_02","Hold up!"
"loc_mex_cook_08_01","It's supposed to be muriatic acid!"
"loc_mex_cook_10_05","No, it's chloride, hydrogen chloride."
"loc_mex_cook_12_19","I had a feeling that was the wrong ingredient..."
"loc_mex_cook_14_01","Hide the meth nearby and then let's cook another round."
"loc_mex_cook_17_01","Another batch done!"
"loc_pent_01_01","Alright, chops. You'll have to get by the lobby security and get to the elevator. They got guards, cams, and metal detectors. You know the drill, yeah? Get going."
"loc_pent_08_03","The elevator needs to be disabled. Rewire the fuse box."
"loc_pent_14_02","Once it's there, cut through the window to get to the platform, then use it to get to the penthouse balcony."
"loc_pent_14_03","Use the glass cutters once the platform is in place. Then move it across to the balcony."
"loc_pent_34_03","Nicely done! Go to the window cleaning platform for extraction if you are ready to get out of there. This is our payday!"
"loc_pent_50_03","Find the generator and start it. The weight of the elevator should be enough to pull those doors off their hinges."
"loc_pent_73_03","That keycard leads to another gold stash. There is no such thing as too much gold."
"loc_pent_82_01","The thermite is doing it's thing. Give it a bit and you're in. "
"loc_pent_87_02","The cops cut the power for the lights! Fix it!"
"loc_pex_03_01","You need to get inside the building."
"loc_pex_04_03","You should find the chief's office on the upper floor. The evidence should be on his computer."
"loc_pex_08_03","You got that key tag?"
"loc_pex_10_01","What are you waiting for? Go to the computer."
"loc_pex_10_03","Go to the computer, friends."
"loc_pex_23_03","Keep looking for the armory."
"loc_pex_25_03","You need to go recode the key tag."
"loc_pex_27_01","And you're in!"
"loc_pex_28_02","A door breaker! Perfect!"
"loc_pex_34_02","They tied him down. We'll need to cut him loose."
"loc_pex_52_04","Very good! The bird is out of the cage!"
"loc_pex_62_05","Don't give up! It's got to be in here somewhere!"
"loc_pex_71_03","Don't let them start those sprinklers!"
"loc_pex_76_02","Hack the door to get it open!"
"loc_pex_88_03","Get those restraints off the prisoner!"
"loc_ranc_02_02","Use thermite on the gate."
"loc_ranc_02_03","Come on, chops. Open the gate."
"loc_ranc_10A_01","The data is locked behind a voice recognition lock.  Plant the bugs someplace where you can get Esteban talking. Maybe try to piss him off?"
"loc_ranc_11_03","After you set the bugs, you'll need Esteban to speak up. What can we do to get him talking?"
"loc_ranc_13_01","We need Esteban's fingerprints. Grab some tape or something and put it on a surface he's touched"
"loc_ranc_13_03","If you set down some tape, you could probably copy Esteban's fingerprints off something."
"loc_ranc_15_02","No way to get Esteban's voice now that he's dead. Let's look for another way to open the laptop."
"loc_ranc_29_03","Reset the power to that box!"
"loc_ranc_35_01","Almost gave me a heart attack. Let's get back to finding those weapons."
"loc_ranc_38_02","Those chops took apart some of the best guns. If we reassemble them, we can pawn them off for a lot more money. Ever use a weapons workshop before?"
"loc_ranc_39_02","Put the gun parts together at one of the workbenches. How hard can it be?"
"loc_ranc_43A_03","I think that turret is one of my designs! It's the real deal."
"loc_ranc_44_02","So much for Plan A!"
"loc_ranc_56_01","Time to make some real money. The weapons workshop is out in the barns. Find a way to get through the gate. There must be something around you can use."
"loc_ranc_61_02","Don't worry, the C4 won't go off until you're out of the blast zone. Rig it up."
"loc_ranc_75A_02","You can reposition that turret if you want!"
"loc_ranc_75_01","They'll neutralize the acid, now! We need to make sure the workshop is wrecked for good. Our contact hid some C4 nearby. Rig the benches to blow."
"loc_ranc_75_02","The acid's working too slowly! Luckily, our insider hid some C4 in one of the barns. Let's take that workshop out with a bang."
"loc_rvd_03_01","Cover the doors! Coppers are there!"
"loc_rvd_05_01","Can't believe they managed to pull it off. Never really thought Bain could be that vulnerable."
"loc_rvd_09_02","Don't forget to pick up that saw."
"loc_sah_01_02","There are metal detectors all around the entrance, you'll need to get around them."
"loc_sah_02_04","You gotta find a way in."
"loc_sah_05_02","You got metal security doors blocking the storage room. I can unlock them remotely if you hack their control boxes."
"loc_sah_06_02","There should be two of them."
"loc_sah_16_03","Blerrie, are you still standing around?"
"loc_sah_22_01","Nicely done. Now get into that office, friends."
"loc_sah_25_03","You get into that computer yet?"
"loc_sah_29_02","Ach, you chops put in the wrong code!"
"loc_sah_32_03","Bah, surveillance didn't show that. Well, you gotta get through it."
"loc_sah_34_01","Are you looking for something to use?"
"loc_sah_39_03","Great, now get out of there while you can."
"loc_sah_51_02","Nicely done, now get to the other one."
"loc_sah_54_01","You need to patch me in so I can open those doors."
"loc_sah_59_03","The code is likely in the auctioneer's office, but you gotta get in there first. The auctioneer has a keycard to the door. Make him give it to you!"
"loc_sah_65_03","The auctioneer has fled the building! You'll never get the keycard now, so just stick a drill on that door and bore it open."
"loc_sah_66_01","There, now time to get inside the auctioneer's office to grab the code."
"loc_sah_68_02","The drill has stopped. You gotta restart it!"
"loc_sah_72_02","Dwankie cops have stopped the hack! Get it going again!"
"loc_sah_74_02","You need to reconnect the juice!"
"loc_sah_77_02","There's a time lock on the door because of the alarm. You have to wait a bit."
"loc_sah_86_01","C'mon, grab the dinges!"
"loc_sah_97_01","We're running low on spending money, so if you find anything else worth taking..."
"loc_sah_97_03","We're going to need to fund some upgrades soon, so feel free to grab some more loot."
"loc_sah_98_02","Ooh, nice bit of hardware, that! Going to be useful for sure."
"loc_sand_04_02","Where are you on accessing that camera feed?"
"loc_sand_07_02","Have you found a shipping manifest yet?"
"loc_sand_105a_03","Recharge the defibrillator and zap him again!"
"loc_sand_105_01","Hurry, friends. Vlad will not last long without help!"
"loc_sand_105_03","You gotta give his heart a good skop with that defibrillator. "
"loc_sand_106_02","Ok, CLEAR!"
"loc_sand_10_03","Now, get to the warehouse and rescue Vlad, yeah?"
"loc_sand_119_03","I just thought of something Jiu Feng mentioned... something we should do before going past those bollards."
"loc_sand_129_02","There's a lever that controls the bollards nearby. Pull it and keep moving."
"loc_sand_131_02","You can either get that truck out of the way or go through the warehouse."
"loc_sand_133_02","Maneuver the landing ramp so the skid loader can board the ship."
"loc_sand_18_02","There's a master keycard that's always kept in the foreman's office. Get it."
"loc_sand_19_02","Have you found the master keycard yet?"
"loc_sand_20_01","Ach, some laanie kak having a coffee break in there. We need to trick him out of there."
"loc_sand_25_02",""Come on duuuuude. There's cake for you in the kitchen! That nice..uh... new receptionist Doris left it for you!""
"loc_sand_27_02","To the warehouse!"
"loc_sand_30_03","Vlad, the poor dwankie. Is he still breathing?"
"loc_sand_39_04","Friends! You must gather your party before venturing forth."
"loc_sand_45_03","If there's one thing they have here, it's equipment to move containers. So get on it, yeah?"
"loc_sand_46_02","Ok, before we take care of those bollards, let's do a little detour."
"loc_sand_49_03","Did you find anything in the office?"
"loc_sand_59_03","Those dock hands... get them out of there so you can move the pallet jack."
"loc_sand_67_02","That's kind of what I said. But he's tough. Like an old shoe is our Vlad."
"loc_sand_82_01","The container belongs to the Lao Che shipping company. Get inside their warehouse and free our Ukrainian."
"loc_sand_84_03","We need to overload that keypad. Hack into the computer so we can set up a voltage spike."
"loc_sand_85_01","We need to get inside that warehouse, so get the computer hack going."
"loc_sand_88_03","You can now overload by flipping the power switch."
"loc_sand_93_01","Find us a gas canister so that we can smoke that dwankie out of the office."
"loc_sand_93_02","Look around for a tube of gas."
"loc_sand_99_02","Open the warehouse door. Vlad needs us, chop-chop!"
"loc_sand_99_03","Got to get that warehouse door open. Vlad's time might be running out."
"loc_sand_intro4a_02","That's why this Wang-dwankie is so adamant about paying us a visit?"
"loc_skm_03_02","This thing is about to start. Everyone ready?"
"loc_skm_12_01","Look out for snipers!"
"loc_skm_13_02","You got a SWAT van coming!"
"loc_skm_17_03","They blew the wall into little itty bits!"
"loc_skm_21_03","Don't let the coppers take the asset."
"loc_skm_21_07","You'll lose the asset if you're not careful!"
"loc_tag_03_02","Have you located the security gate yet?"
"loc_tag_09_03","Not the right one it seems, you got to keep looking."
"loc_tag_10_03","That's it friends, hurry back and get through the gate, yeah?"
"loc_tag_13_03","You need to find Garrett's office."
"loc_tag_14_01","There's got to be lot's of good stuff we can use or sell around here, so keep your eyes peeled for anything that might be good to take along."
"loc_tag_21_02","Right, now let's see if he took the bait."
"loc_tag_25_03","Disabling one more box should be enough."
"loc_tag_37_02","See any numbers connected to us?"
"loc_tag_48_03","He might leave if we turn off the lights. Do you see a circuit box nearby?"
"loc_tag_49_05","You need to shut off the lights, friends."
"loc_tag_54_01","Use the one owned by "Chloe"."
"loc_tag_56_03","Taylor's computer should be nearby."
"loc_tag_58_01","Find Chloe's desk and computer."
"loc_tag_61_03","Feed the Fed, friends."
"loc_tag_64_02","What... that's what the Elephant had? Isn't that... No, not quite eh? Just take it and get out of there."
"loc_tag_67_02","But look... the keycard."
"loc_tag_70_02","Head back to the skylight where you came in and bring the box."
"loc_tag_81_04","There is still loot to be secured."
"loc_tag_81_06","Use the zipline to secure the loot."
"loc_tag_81_07","Get all the loot onto the zipline."
"loc_tag_86_03","The code begins with a five, according to my source."
"loc_tag_89_03","The code begins with an eight, according to my source."
"loc_tag_92_03","There we go!"
"loc_tag_intro_01b","I'm impressed Hoxton isn't having a nervous breakdown coming back to this place."
"loc_trai_11_01","Now we know which train to hit, but our contact said the wagons are rigged with motion sensors. The little kaks should be linked to a control console somewhere in the railyard."
"loc_trai_11_02","Before we get inside the wagons, we need to take care of the motion sensors rigged to the train. Gemma's contact says they're linked to a control console somewhere in the railyard."
"loc_trai_24B_01","Good memory! The vault should be open now."
"loc_trai_27_02","Howdy, y'all! We got an order from the top dogs to prep Train C-33 for an unscheduled departure. So if you see that train on the move, don't throw a hissy fit. It's all good. Peachy keen."
"loc_trai_28_02","Hook me up to the PA system. I've got a Texas accent all ready to go."
"loc_trai_30_01","We need to detach the locomotive, fuel it up, and get it moving."
"loc_trai_39_03","Let's get out of here! Jump on the train! You know, choo-choo and whatnot!"
"loc_trai_49A_01","Three...Two...One!"
"loc_trai_50_03","Rig the pipeline to blow! Before it's too late!"
"loc_trai_56_02","Look for the wagons with the fake shipping brand."
"loc_trai_59_03","Once you burn your way into the wagons, those plates are as good as ours!"
"loc_trai_68_03","Get the crane into position!"
"loc_trai_81_02","We can't leave until the turntable's fixed!"
"loc_vit_104_03","Pick up the keycard so we can get to the next part!"
"loc_vit_107_03","Domkops! What are they doing?!"
"loc_vit_109_03","You gotta find a way in. Keep looking!"
"loc_vit_117_02","Can't do anything until you hook me up."
"loc_vit_120_03","Just... a little... longer....."
"loc_vit_125_02","The dinges crashed, Can't figure out why..."
"loc_vit_131_01","Friends, find the other computer and disable the firewall."
"loc_vit_13_02","Good, good. No mistakes."
"loc_vit_140_03","OK, get ready, here I come!"
"loc_vit_19_03","If I were them, I'd keep the keycard in a safe."
"loc_vit_20_01","Look behind things. Should be fairly obvious, yeah?"
"loc_vit_28_02","The stick should be compatible with any laptop around there."
"loc_vit_30_03","Don't wait too long friends, enter that code ASAP."
"loc_vit_31_03","That worked perfectly. Take the keycard and go."
"loc_vit_49_01","You need to get the computer running again!"
"loc_vit_50_02","Ach, I'm being stopped by a firewall. Get to one of the other computers and see if you can help me through."
"loc_vit_56_01","Uh, yeah. Everything is fine and dandy here. Just... routine checkups."
"loc_vit_66_02","OK, time to take your masks off and make your way casually out the door."
"loc_vit_67_02","I can't come and get you if you don't hurry, friends! They've got F35s flying CAP around the White House! "
"loc_vit_69_01","Friends, I'm waiting for you!"
"loc_vit_71_02","We gotta do this the loud way!"
"loc_vit_75_01","Ach, it's blocked. Can't use C4 either. Check that R-FID reader!"
"loc_vit_79_03","Hurry up and look through the rooms!"
"loc_vit_81_01","Don't let the enemies interrupt the hack."
"loc_vit_92_01","Ok, now use the thermite you found on those shutters."
"loc_vit_94_01","The thermite has burned through, so get inside."
"loc_vit_96_03","You just gotta turn everything upside-down, friends!"
"loc_vit_98_03","You can use the modified drill I sent with you to get through. "
"loc_vit_99_03","You'll need to get it some juice from a wall socket."
"lt1_aes_01_20","Oh, fuck me sideways!"
"lt1_nm_01_10","Don't mess around, this isn't all of it!"
"lt1_sfa_01_02","What are you doing over there!?"
"lt1_trado_02_02","... no deal, assholes!"
"lt1_trado_02_04","... deal's off! So fuck off!"
"lt1_trafi_01_05","Adios muchachos."
"lt1_trasi_01_01","Come on now..."
"lt1_trasi_02_04","... put all the wares in the car!"
"lt1_tra_02_02","... put the delivery in the car..."
"lt1_tra_03_02","... when it's done, we'll give you what you want."
"lt2_aes_01_02","Who let them in? What the fuck?"
"lt2_aes_01_07","Fuck!"
"lt2_aes_01_10","What the fuck's happening!?"
"lt2_gc_01_06","Put them down!"
"lt2_gc_01_13","You'll PAY for this!"
"lt2_gc_01_18","You're dead!"
"lt2_pa_01_06","We gotta get outta here!"
"lt2_pft_02_03","... Shoot these fuckers!"
"lt2_pft_02_06","... Waste 'em!"
"lt2_sfa_01_01","Hey, over here!"
"lt2_sfa_01_03","Get over here!"
"lt2_tfp_02_04","... Put the idiots out of their misery man!"
"lt2_trald_02_01","... We'll take what you have."
"lt2_trami_01_02","Where is it?"
"mc1_fwb_01_02","Now, if I understand you, you don't want to give me some money to provide capital for an operation running smokes out of Mexico?"
"mch_brn_03_01b","Don't say a word. I'm well aware you're not only here to save my ass. Rust still wants his bike back, right? Well, to do that I'm gonna need all the parts, and they're spread all over the place."
"mch_brn_06_01b","Hey! Don't leave me!"
"mch_brn_07_04b","Oh, shit! "
"mch_brn_12_02b","Oh, yeah. Wait. You're gonna need this blowtorch to get inside."
"mch_brn_15_01b","Fuck, this is gonna be tricky... Yeah, you can't do it yourselves. Take me to the garage where I can take a bike apart to collect some special shit for this babe."
"mch_brn_16_01b","I'll get blasted if I go alone, so you need to take me to the garage. I don't know about y'all, but I want to get this shit done and over with. "
"mch_brn_20_03b","Come on, where's that coke? I'm thirsty!"
"mch_brn_21_03b","Done! Get me the next piece!"
"mch_pal_01_04","You wanna know how I make my money? Hard work. Right through the night."
"mch_pal_02_02","I kinda like what I do, you know? And when I'm creative, I feel like I'm top of the world really because, you know, how many guys can do what I do?"
"mch_pal_04a_05","We rolled the year back. It was like '69 on the Strip. Caddy was low-ridin' 'cos of all the ass in the back."
"mch_pal_05_02","You guys're dressed pretty sharply for pool repair men. Guess you got your overalls in those bags. "
"mch_pal_12_02","Bodhi's pool repair, should've known."
"mch_pal_12_06","Uh, come on!"
"mch_pal_intro_01","Hey, it's Mitchell, over at Keel Street. The pipes, you know? The ones you "fixed"? Yeah, they're leaking again!"
"mrb_rvd1_09_02","So, I just heard from the boss. He's on his way here to get us but he's pretty pissed, so you guys might wanna bail before he gets here."
"mrb_rvd1_09_03","The boss just called and he's pissed. Got a guy comin' to get us but you should probably bail. I'll make sure you get your cut."
"mrb_rvd1_14_06","Cabot's gonna go nuts when he hears about this."
"mrb_rvd1_15_04","Hey, crooks don't slide on hoods. Only cops."
"mrb_rvd1_21_01","On the fifth day of Christmas..."
"mrb_rvd1_23_01","Seven sins to carry away."
"mrb_rvd1_26_01","Ten is our magic number, guys, unless you want to keep going."
"mrb_rvd1_26_02","That's our minimum, unless you want to try and get more."
"mrb_rvd1_27_04","Still more? Almost feels greedy."
"mrp_rvd_03_01","Hurry up Goddamnit!"
"mrp_rvd_03_08","They're right on top of me people, can't fucking hold out much longer!"
"mrp_rvd_07_02","If we get outta this one I might just leave this fuckin' town."
"mrp_rvd_09_02","Best of luck with your boss and all guys."
"mrp_rvd_11_07","How the fuck did they know we were gonna be here!?"
"neg_skm_04_02","Say hello to our new LMG Dozers..."
"neg_skm_14_02","The asset has been retrieved. That's a win for the boys in blue, over."
"nmh_intro_01_09","I'm smoking anywhere I want!"
"nmh_intro_02_05","Let's go! Let's go! We can all fit in the elevator."
"nmh_intro_03_07","Hey Bain, great briefing... I heard jack-shit! Let's just aah, play it by ear."
"nmh_intro_04_02","You're breaking up... Can you hear me ok?"
"nmh_intro_05_04","Right!"
"pil_pal_04_02","This is private property, get out of here!"
"plc_cs1_01_02","This is Captain Rogers of the MPDC. We got a call from GenSec. Seems they got some concerns about what's happening there. I'm dispatching some uniformed officers to make sure everything's OK."
"pln_al1_01_03","If you can get through this quietly, you should be able to just melt away with the crowd."
"pln_al1_04_02","Nice work. The C4 will alert the crowd unless we time it with Alesso's pyrotechnics. Head upstairs and patch me into the tech booth."
"pln_al1_07_01","Bile's on his way with the chopper!"
"pln_al1_20_01","That's the last door!"
"pln_al1_23_02","More C4. Not quite enough. Find the last batch. Keep searching."
"pln_al1_25_03","The garage is right below that Investment vault. It's where you need to plant the explosives."
"pln_al1_26_01","Head to the pyro booth. Top floor. Hurry!"
"pln_al1_27_03","The crowd is heaving tonight. Let's give them a great show."
"pln_al1_32_01","Console on the right!"
"pln_al1_32_03","Right!"
"pln_al1_35_03","Right! And...left!"
"pln_al1_38_02","That's the cutter done. Let the money rain down!"
"pln_al1_40_03","That chute there can transport the loot to the lobby. Might speed things up."
"pln_al1_50_01","Okay, ping our Inside Guy when you're ready to de-mask and get out of there. He'll move the loot, so be sure you secure in the vent what you want to take."
"pln_al1_51_03","When you're ready to get out of here, answer the intercom. Our guy will get the loot out, so make sure you've secured what you wanna take."
"pln_al1_52_03","Got our seven bucks back, gang. Stretch goals are good."
"pln_al1_55_01","It was loud and got attention. Excellent work. Tough for GenSec though. Their new design is a joke."
"pln_al1_55_02","You did it, you got a ton of money and got a lot of attention. And GenSec deserve to suffer publicly."
"pln_as1_01_02","Jesus, it looked bad on the news, but..."
"pln_as1_05_02","Now, get those trucks opened. Let's get inside them."
"pln_as1_06_02","You can bet they're important if Vlad sent us to this hellhole for them."
"pln_as1_07_03","Get the safes out, gang. Yeah, I know it's over a hundred degrees, but get to it."
"pln_as1_08_02","A little C4 will deal with that. I'm sending some now. Hold on."
"pln_as1_09_03","Take the C4, crew. That will deal with the construction yard wall."
"pln_as1_10_01","All right. Now slap the C4 on there. We're busting our way out."
"pln_as1_14_03","Get inside the truck! The chopper is going to airlift the whole damn thing out!"
"pln_as1_16_03","Guys, the wreckage is incredible. Rubble blocking everything."
"pln_as1_19_02","This would be easier if the city wasn't a ruin. Just hold on."
"pln_as1_20_01","Got it! Construction yard, with a truck. Looks like the best way out of here, but you'll need C4 to bust that wall. Sending it now. Mind the safes!"
"pln_as1_brf_01_01","Hey, you guys see the news?! Big quake just hit the West Coast! LA is completely messed up. And that's where you're headed. Seems Vlad has set up some big deal to move some freight from Seattle to DC. The shippers he contracted were in LA when the quake hit - I guess they were going to ship out of Long Beach. Vlad wants his freight secured safely. No time for planning on this one. LA is wrecked, and the roads are messed up so we're going to drop you in by chopper."
"pln_at1_cbf_01_02","GenSec are a big security company on the East Coast. Got a great reputation with the banks and politicians, but today we're going to see what we can do about that. Got a tip-off about a convoy coming into the city. We're going after it."
"pln_at1_cnc_05_01","The underpass is a vulnerable spot for the convoy. Hit it hard."
"pln_at1_end_01_01","Haha! You did it! This jewelry should be worth a few bucks don't you think?"
"pln_at1_end_03_01","Sweet, sweet gold! Great job everyone!"
"pln_at1_gen_05_02","Get it to the van!"
"pln_at1_gen_06_01","Use those roofs to your advantage!"
"pln_at1_gen_07_02","Check the stores if you want some extra money."
"pln_at1_gen_11_03","Alright! The van should be coming in soon!"
"pln_at1_par_02_01","Bullseye! You guys OK? That was one hell of a collision! Get to work on those transports!"
"pln_at1_par_03_01","Holy crap! We knocked all three trucks off the road. Make it count!"
"pln_bb1_05_02","Firewalls are tripped. We're going to need a local port - one of the staff terminals. Check them out."
"pln_bb1_08_03","Accessing now..."
"pln_bb1_10_03","This one's a wash-out. Another one. Quick!"
"pln_bb1_12_01","One of the staff terminals is holding a code. Find it, and start hacking."
"pln_bb1_18_02","OK. Now let's restart the time lock and see if this worked."
"pln_bb1_19_02","Great. Now keep the cops away from it."
"pln_bb1_20_02","Now while the time lock counts down, you can get ahead of the action. There's a zip-line on the roof that will need setting up."
"pln_bb1_28_02","Operate the crane, guys. Get that piggy into position."
"pln_bb1_33_02","This place has a formidable vault. Thankfully, I found just the tool for it. Get that bag to the vault."
"pln_bb1_34_02","What a drill. Let's see if it works as good as it looks. Fire it up."
"pln_bb1_40_01","The van's outside. Get stowing that loot!"
"pln_bb1_42_02","I got the van in the garage, but you need to go through the elevator shaft."
"pln_bb1_44_02","The bus is all set up to... Well, you worry about sending the signal. Then you'll see."
"pln_bb1_48_02","Who said the buses in this town can't keep to a schedule! Get moving that loot."
"pln_bb1_55_02","Almost there. Final protocol - the managers code. Check his computer."
"pln_bb1_62_02","Time to light it up, guys."
"pln_bb1_end_04_01","This will forever be a Red Letter day for the criminal community. The day the Payday Gang broke the Benevolent."
"pln_bigoil_stage1_06_any_01","Looks like some codes, that'll come in handy."
"pln_bigoil_stage1_15_any_01","They're coming from the east, by the forest."
"pln_bigoil_stage2_01_any_01","Alright, do you see the house? Get inside and find the server room. We need to hack into the security system to get to the lab."
"pln_bigoil_stage2_20_any_02","This one seems to be malfunctioning, I'll be back to pick up another one."
"pln_bigoil_stage2_end_a_02","Well, no fusion, but at least we get to drive gas-guzzling cars a lot longer this way. I love my Firebird as much as the next man."
"pln_bigoil_stage2_end_b_02","Good work people. That was a hell of a thing to move, but it's the right engine and it's locked up tight. Maybe one day we'll go freelancing and take it back, huh?"
"pln_bo1_01_any_02","OK, that's the clubhouse. Bikers' got the address we need. Sneak in."
"pln_bo1_02_any_01","OK guys, search the place. They have a safe somewhere, it's probably in there."
"pln_bo1_02_any_02","OK, no time to lose, get all that intel."
"pln_bo1_02_any_03","Don't let them destroy any intel. Get it all!"
"pln_bo1_08_any_01","That might be useful."
"pln_bo1_13_any_01","They're coming from the east, by the forest."
"pln_bo1_17_any_02","You guys OK? Bikers sure act like it is war - go get 'em!"
"pln_bo1_18_any_01","Damn it, they're burning it!"
"pln_bo2_24_any_01","The prototypes should be in the lab. To gain access to it we need to hack the main server. Find the server room."
"pln_bo2_25_any_01","Remember you're looking for the server room."
"pln_bo2_25_any_02","Server room - find it."
"pln_bo2_25_any_03","Find the server room. "
"pln_bo2_28_any_01","Make sure the guards don't spot us now."
"pln_bo2_31_any_01","Great job, I'm connected."
"pln_bo2_32_any_01","It's done! Open the lab door!"
"pln_bo2_33_any_03","Ah OK... So, seems to be a bit too many of them here. Fusion engines that is. Find the correct one."
"pln_bo2_34_any_02","Check his papers, notes and computers. Anything for a hint on what is correct here."
"pln_bo2_36_any_01","Alright, the chopper is on its way."
"pln_bo2_37_any_03","Helicopters landing. Load up the engine and hope it is the one."
"pln_bo2_41_any_02","Sorry guys, he says this ain't the one. The chopper will be back in a few so you can get another one over here, hopefully the right one."
"pln_bo2_44_any_01","Dr Fantastic! You guys sure are smart. We got the right engine and you are rich. Now make it out of there! Chopper is incoming."
"pln_bo2_45_any_01","Mr Dr Fantastic Sir! You nailed it. Thats some science - well done team. Get your big brains out of there! Use the plane."
"pln_bo2_49_any_03","Finally, the chopper pilot is heading back to get you guys. Sorry for the hold up."
"pln_bo2_51_any_01","Damn it! The alarm! The whole house knows we are coming now!"
"pln_bph_01_01","Dentist, you asshole, I'm going to drill out those glowing eyes of yours..."
"pln_bph_03_01","Kento, you got trouble coming..."
"pln_bph_06_03","Dentist... Elephant... Sputnik... gotta warn..."
"pln_branchbank_cash_brf_speak_04","A little cash goes a long way. The local Harvest & Trustee branch bank needs to be lightened of its load. Let's do this bank hit, get their vault open, and fill our pockets a little."
"pln_branchbank_cash_cnc_02","We got a cash situation in this bank. They have missed their delivery to the HQ this week. Don't everyone sigh all at once..."
"pln_branchbank_depositbox_a_intro_a_02","Got a deposit box opportunity in this bank. I have inside info."
"pln_branchbank_deposit_cnc_07","Happy birthday. Vault full of freshly loaded safe deposit boxes. Who's in?"
"pln_branchbank_gold_a_intro_a_04","Crew this is hot off the wire. I have a gold deposit waiting for us. "
"pln_branchbank_gold_stage1_brief_02b","Then get the gold out. It's heavy, so bring strong people. Get the loot to the escape van - at least as much as you think you can. Good luck!"
"pln_branchbank_random_brf_speak_01b","There's a bank vault we need to hit... "
"pln_branchbank_random_brf_speak_03","People, you've probably done this a dozen times. Hitting the Harvest & Trustee Bank over on 5th. No idea what's in there but we know it's gonna be sweet. Get that vault open and away we go. You in?"
"pln_branchbank_random_stage1_brief_02b","You're going to need to get into the vault using a thermal drill, get whatever's in there bagged up and moved back to the escape car. Use your judgment and don't be greedy... Good luck, folks."
"pln_branchbank_random_stage1_intro_a_03","Everyone, you know how it's done. My guy dropped the thermal drill in the parking lot, so grab that before you make your move inside. Some surveillance would be smart."
"pln_branchbank_stage1_01_any_02","OK folks, my inside man stashed the thermal lance you're gonna need for the vault around the back. Recon the spot to find it."
"pln_branchbank_stage1_04_any_01","It's a straight cash hit. You know how this goes."
"pln_branchbank_stage1_08_any_01","Alright, bring it to the van, it's right around the corner."
"pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_08","Vault's cracked, let's see what we got!"
"pln_branchbank_stage1_16_any_01","Cash time. Bag it!"
"pln_branchbank_stage1_17_any_01","Jackpot... Look at all the cash... Get it out now!"
"pln_branchbank_stage1_19_any_01","More cops on the way."
"pln_branchbank_stage1_21_any_01","Don't forget about those safe deposit boxes folks, can be good stuff in there."
"pln_branchbank_stage1_22_any_01","Street's clear for now!"
"pln_branchbank_stage1_29_any_01","OK! you've got enough... Or you can stay for more."
"pln_branchbank_stage1_32_any_02","They're in the bank!"
"pln_branchbank_stage1_34_any_02","We're looking good... Looking good."
"pln_branchbank_stage1_39_any_01","It's open! Search through the deposit boxes!"
"pln_branchbank_stage1_40_any_01","It's open! Let's see what we got!"
"pln_branchbank_stage1_44_any_01","Alright, bring it to the van, it's right across the street."
"pln_branchbank_stage1_80_any_01","OK people, there's the bank, I don't know what's in there but it's gonna be good..."
"pln_branchbank_stage1_end_a_08","Loot bags in place and money ready to get divided. You guys never disappoint. Love it!"
"pln_branchbank_stage1_end_a_11","I don't say superb often, but I'm saying it now. Good work."
"pln_briefing_start_b_05","...This is the setup."
"pln_brn_01_01","That was too damn close. Now, we don't have time to stand around, gang. Get him off that chair so we can get this over with."
"pln_brn_06_01","The bikers are apparently storing stuff in an old bunker. The mechanic said you would find a seat for the bike in there."
"pln_brn_08_02","Perfect, now deliver the part to the mechanic so he can work!"
"pln_brn_08_04","You got what he asked for, now you need to bring it to him."
"pln_brn_08_05","That's the part he asked for. One step closer gang."
"pln_brn_08_06","Excellent, that's a part in the bag. Bring it back to the mechanic."
"pln_brn_09_03","We're taking some of these nice weapons with us. But how, that's the question..."
"pln_brn_12_01","Just keep driving straight!"
"pln_ca1_01_01","You're in civilian mode. No guns, no masks - invisible to security. When you're ready, find your gear. Micho the janitor left it in a guitar case somewhere."
"pln_ca1_02_03","We've got cops on the way, so don't dawdle. Find the C4! Check the guard room."
"pln_ca1_03_01","OK, let's blow this place. C4's in the limo. Take it!"
"pln_ca1_100_03","There's The Dentist's whatever. Haul it out of there and we are done with him."
"pln_ca1_101_03","We can now redeem the Dentist's contract. You can bounce, or treat Vegas to a Payday Gang party and loot the place."
"pln_ca1_108_02","And... great! There's the top of the vault!"
"pln_ca1_10_01","104!"
"pln_ca1_113_02","Great. Now turn her back on."
"pln_ca1_116_02","Don't let BFD overheat. Refill that tank with water!"
"pln_ca1_118_01","Whatever it is, we got it! Get it to the limo."
"pln_ca1_119_02","Great. Now toss it up onto BFD."
"pln_ca1_124_02","Zero!"
"pln_ca1_129_02","Five!"
"pln_ca1_138_03","Reception. Okay, we may need it later - note where it is."
"pln_ca1_147_01","This is the Security Center."
"pln_ca1_150_01","Get the blueprints in the archives. They're somewhere in the employee only areas.."
"pln_ca1_154_03","Let me check. Room..."
"pln_ca1_157_02","I think they saw that from the ISS!"
"pln_ca1_158_01","What the hell..."
"pln_ca1_158_02","I don't... know..."
"pln_ca1_159_05","So good to talk to you, sir."
"pln_ca1_15_02","Nice. Now go get that guest list from reception."
"pln_ca1_165_02","Perhaps sir has a sweet tooth? How would you like enough cake to choke a camel?"
"pln_ca1_165_04","Don't forget we have enough sugary desserts to give you diabetes."
"pln_ca1_166_03","You can get a side of cornbread with that. Yummy!"
"pln_ca1_167_01","All yours for the price of... say... 18 bucks."
"pln_ca1_167_03","All You Can Eat, remember. Just 18 bucks."
"pln_ca1_168_02","Fix up BFD and let's finish this. Come on, crew, we're so close."
"pln_ca1_171_03","Remember to screw that winch down good."
"pln_ca1_173_03","We need a code to open the armory. Three digits. Colour coded. They're somewhere in the Grin. Get searching!"
"pln_ca1_22_01","Find the blue bottle and spike it."
"pln_ca1_24_01","That's it, buddy. Drink up."
"pln_ca1_27_01","Opening the vault needs a three digit code. Each digit is held by a manager, and each is in a computer briefcase. We need that code. Find them."
"pln_ca1_30_01","That's the alarm. OK, gang. Plan B. Force our way through."
"pln_ca1_35_01","That's all the numbers needed for the armory. Go enter that code."
"pln_ca1_37_02","Now load up on C4. You'll need it."
"pln_ca1_38_01","Now plant the C4 in the main hall. The vault is right below. Two possible spots to blow. Hope lady luck is with us!"
"pln_ca1_44_02","Nice! Next, we're going to signal the blimp, and for something like that we need a big signal. A fireworks display! Find them!"
"pln_ca1_47_01","The drill can't be dropped through that skylight barrier. Gotta open it from the security center."
"pln_ca1_49_03","The cops pulled the hack. Get there and reboot it."
"pln_ca1_52_02","All right. Now this is why we brought the winch. Hook it to BFD, and it'll get the position right."
"pln_ca1_57_02","Power's down. Get BFD reconnected, gang!"
"pln_ca1_63_02","She's all done! Quickly, down into the vault!"
"pln_ca1_64_01","We're here! Find The Dentist's loot, and let's get it out of here."
"pln_ca1_65_03","You can bounce now, or you can stay and give the Golden Grin a thorough cleaning."
"pln_ca1_67_01","Over there. Your gear's in that guitar case."
"pln_ca1_72_03","Don't forget to send me the list. Head to IT. Plug it in."
"pln_ca1_73_02","That's him. Got his name, SSN, last time he took a dump... Check the screen in IT. Find him. Says here he loves the slots, so maybe that will be where he is."
"pln_ca1_91_02","That's the first number. Keep looking. Two to go."
"pln_ca1_92_03","Second digit for the code. Now, just get the last number and we're set."
"pln_ca1_94_02","Outstanding! That's the vault code. Once we're in the Security Center, we can open the vault with it."
"pln_ca1_97_02","We got the pit boss' code. Nice."
"pln_ca1_intro_02_02","Arriving in style!"
"pln_can_02_01","Don't forget to find the elves. Shout at them to make them work."
"pln_ce_01_05","Escape is ready. Van is in place, engine running."
"pln_ch1_01_04","Remember, we need to keep these cars in pristine condition. No scratches, and definitely no bullet holes. Which means no cops. So keep it quiet."
"pln_ch1_01_06","The market for these cars demands they are in perfect condition. Keep it quiet, and you'll keep the cops away. Which means no bullet holes."
"pln_ch1_06_01","Damn. It's locked. Hmmm. Alright. The manager's still there. Take him as hostage. See if he has any information about the lock."
"pln_ch1_06_03","And... it's locked. Damn! OK. Stay quiet. The manager must be around there somewhere. Take him hostage. He should be able to get us in."
"pln_ch1_07_03","I've accessed the manager's file. He'll be wearing a suit."
"pln_ch1_08_01","I can also see that he's balding. You copy that? Look for the old, balding guy."
"pln_ch1_09_03","Manager's got a black suit, thinning hair. Find him, tie him - that might make him more helpful."
"pln_ch1_15_03","Gang, the C4 is in the van. Get it, and plant it."
"pln_ch1_17_02","OK, I'll set these off remotely. Now get back to the storage room. It's open!"
"pln_ch1_21_02","Now jump into the car. Oh, and keep your head down - it's time to *blow* the joint."
"pln_ch1_23_02","OK, now drive. Go, go, go!"
"pln_ch1_29_02","Ah hell. Wrong pc. Alarms are tripped. Cops are en-route. Not much time now."
"pln_ch1_31_02","Now drive!"
"pln_ch1_34_02","Now bail out of there!"
"pln_ch1_35_01","Nice, I'll detonate these. You just be ready with the cars."
"pln_ch1_cbf_01_01","The Teuer dealership is one of the few East Coast showrooms that sells Falcogini cars. They just got the hot new model in - the La Troienne. I got some people overseas who are willing to pay big for this little beauty. Get in there, get to the wheels and get them out. Simple, right?"
"pln_ch1_intro_01_02","Pull over here. Alright gang. Let's do this."
"pln_chw_03_04","The front of the train, gang!"
"pln_chw_03_05","Make your way to the front, guys. Come on!"
"pln_chw_03_07","The car we're after is in the front, gang!"
"pln_chw_04_02","Use the blowtorch to create a way through that car."
"pln_chw_06_03","Holy...! They rigged the boxes with C4! Defuse them!"
"pln_chw_08_01","Jackpot! Rust's info was correct. Now, get through the gate and grab the BCI headset and the software."
"pln_chw_10_03","The tech is in our hands! Time to head back to the helicopter! Don't keep Bile waiting."
"pln_chw_11_01","What are you waiting for? Run back to the helicopter and secure the loot!"
"pln_chw_15_01","Damn! The cops have blocked the tracks up ahead, which means you need to be gone before you reach that point. Get the BCI tech and run back to the chopper!"
"pln_chw_16_01","The train is rapidly approaching the cop barricade. I give you a maximum of two minutes to secure the loot and get out."
"pln_chw_16_03","With the speed this train is going, you'll have about two minutes before you reach the barricade. That means two minutes to secure everything and leave!"
"pln_chw_19_02","Damn it! Those oil barrels are in the way. See if you can release the straps, and do it quickly."
"pln_chw_20_01","You'll have to use the blowtorch to get through this gate. Make it quick."
"pln_cp1_01_03","No broken legs? Good. Head into the forest and find that plane. My guess is the pilot will be nearby. Get him someplace safe and we'll evac him by air. Move out!"
"pln_cp1_03_02","Jesus, he's wasted. Stay with him. He's in no shape to defend himself."
"pln_cp1_04_03","Good. I'm sending a chopper to collect him. Keep him safe. He's so wasted I doubt he'd feel the bullets."
"pln_cp1_06_03","Chopper will come back for you, so while we're waiting, why not get looking for Vlad's packages. Could be a nice little bonus."
"pln_cp1_10_02","Sounds like a present fell outta the tree, gang. Might be more of Vlad's coke. Find it."
"pln_cp1_11_02","The night's not so silent. Think I heard another present hit the ground. Find it!"
"pln_cp1_13_01","Oh man, the pilot just went down again. Wake that old wino up!"
"pln_cp1_20_03","Flare is lit. Alright, he sees it. Chopper is in-bound."
"pln_cp1_brf_01_01","We need you there fast, but it's really out in the sticks, so you're going in like the paras. Find the pilot - he's probably near the wreck - and then we'll send in a chopper to extract him. Stay with him til he's safely out. Also, Vlad says that plane was loaded with product. Search the forest and get as much out as you can. Can always use a little extra cash at Christmas."
"pln_cr2_01_03","Docks are right there. Head in. And watch for guards. "
"pln_cr2_02_03","A keycard for the gate. Gonna need another, though."
"pln_cr2_06_01","That's the left panel. Now search for the other keycard. Get the other panel activated."
"pln_cr2_102_02","Guard is down. That's the cameras out of action."
"pln_cr2_103_01","You took care of both guards. Don't have to worry about the cameras anymore."
"pln_cr2_103_02","And that's the guards dealt with. Cameras are no longer a problem."
"pln_cr2_112_01","This is the Storage Room. Check for a keycard. Might be a radio here too."
"pln_cr2_115_03","Ship's there. Get on it! Maybe deploy the zip-line - might speed things up."
"pln_cr2_121_01","You've found the bomb. No need to keep checking the bomb cases!"
"pln_cr2_122_03","You already found the bomb. You can leave the containers alone!"
"pln_cr2_125_03","The Moretta - That's our girl. But we can't get on board here. You have to see her moved to dock 3B."
"pln_cr2_12_03","You need to find keycards. My guess is that the buildings are your best chance."
"pln_cr2_12_05","Find keycards, gang. Check the buildings."
"pln_cr2_13_01","We need the Moretta's comm frequency. It'll be on one of those terminals. Get checking."
"pln_cr2_18_02","Alright, she's berthed! Get up on deck and start searching the containers."
"pln_cr2_18_03","Moretta is in position. Get on deck and look for the explosives. Move!"
"pln_cr2_20_01","No alarm was triggered, so you can simply walk into the containers. Outstanding!"
"pln_cr2_22_01","He's en route now with C4. Just hang in there, gang."
"pln_cr2_24_02","Now plant it on the dock gate."
"pln_cr2_29_02","Boom! "
"pln_cr2_29_03","Just like St Nazaire! "
"pln_cr2_30_03","We can scratch the Captain moving his ship for us now. Nevermind. We can move the ship without him. Hack into the ship control terminal. And don't let the cops interfere with it."
"pln_cr2_33_02","Alright. Let's try this again."
"pln_cr2_34_03","Moretta is powering up. Let it move to its berth. Weapons free."
"pln_cr2_37_01","Drill baby, drill!"
"pln_cr2_38_03","And... Jackpot! Moretta specs including comm frequencies. Great work! Now look for the nearest radio, and let's talk to the Captain."
"pln_cr2_39_01","You can use the crowbar to open up shipping crates."
"pln_cr2_39_03","A crowbar. Good find. Always useful."
"pln_cr2_40_03","Gonna need to call the Moretta, and for that we need the comm frequencies. Search for it."
"pln_cr2_42_01","And here's the second control room for the gate."
"pln_cr2_43_02","These wagons might have something valuable in them. Maybe check them out? "
"pln_cr2_44_03","Well, it's a keycard, and pretty damn useless now. Maybe if you'd found it earlier..."
"pln_cr2_46_03","Great. Now the second card in the other panel, and the Moretta will be free."
"pln_cr2_56_03","The ship is almost there, gang. Be ready."
"pln_cr2_60_01","Nothing in here. Keep looking!"
"pln_cr2_64_03","There's a boat ready for you. Head there.        "
"pln_cr2_65_01","Come on, get to the boat."
"pln_cr2_65_03","Boat's standing by to get you out, guys."
"pln_cr2_68_03","No-one's seen you. Keep it that way. Now, the gate."
"pln_cr2_70_01","They've no clue you're there. Now get to that radio."
"pln_cr2_70_03","Still silent. Nice. Find the radio."
"pln_cr2_73_01","Still no alarms. Now get on the ship."
"pln_cr2_76_03","Damn! It's the alarm. Well, this just got more straightforward. Forget keycards. We're blowing our way through. Light a flare and drop it. Bile will drop you some C4."
"pln_cr2_78_03","The C4 is for blowing the gate. Get it placed."
"pln_cr2_82_01","Get the power back on."
"pln_cr2_86_02","Gang, I can't stress how important electricity is to computers!"
"pln_cr2_87_03","Just a few... More... Seconds."
"pln_cr2_88_03","That manifest you picked up will point us to the right containers."
"pln_cr2_91_03","Your escape driver's parked up. Get back there - now!"
"pln_cr2_92_02","Chopper's waiting for you. Hurry!"
"pln_cr2_93_01","Guys! The chopper! "
"pln_cr2_95_02","The boat won't escape the cops' attention forever. Get there, now!"
"pln_cr2_99_03","Great! Extra loot... Love it!"
"pln_cr2_brf_01_01","The Moretta is sitting in a sealed dock, awaiting customs clearance. This is where you come in. Once you're in the dockyard, you're going to get it moved to a berth from where you can get aboard. From 2B to 3B. Open the dock gates, and let the Captain know he can move. Once the Moretta is berthed in 3B, you can get aboard and boost the explosives. Simple?$NL;$NL;Well, maybe not so simple. Security's too tight for a ship loaded with Balkan farm produce. Starting to guess a lot of shady stuff comes through that route. So be careful."
"pln_cr3_05_01","Pick up that thermite, trust me, you're going to need it."
"pln_cr3_10_02","The ladder and thermite are right there. Don't forget them. "
"pln_cr3_11_01","You're gonna need the thermite to pop the wagon open. Get back and grab it."
"pln_cr3_11_02","You can only melt through that wagon with the thermite, so you better head back and fetch it."
"pln_cr3_16_02","Look around for a ladder. You need it to search the wagons. Maybe it's still attached to one of them."
"pln_cr3_26_01","The hose has come loose. Reconnect it!"
"pln_cr3_29_01","Search the other wagons for C4! It should be inside one of the crates."
"pln_cr3_30_01","There's gotta be explosives in one of the wagons. Search for them!"
"pln_cr3_37_03","That zip-line is your way out - get there!"
"pln_cr3_38_03","Bile's on his way to you, but he can't land with those trees in the way. Find a saw, and clear a way for him, then mark it with flares."
"pln_cr3_39_01","Find that saw! It has to be around here somewhere. Try looking around timber logs."
"pln_cr3_46_02","Chopper's right on top of you. Can you see it?"
"pln_cr3_49_01","Briefcase with high-temperature thermite paste will be waiting for you here."
"pln_cr3_51_02","Get the C4 in there, and get ready!"
"pln_cr3_54_02","That's the pump done. Great work!."
"pln_cs1_01_03","You can try finding vault keycards, two of them, if you want to sneak this place. Maybe in the trunks. Or go loud - it's your choice."
"pln_cs1_02_02","You got one of the keycards, now find the other one."
"pln_cs1_03_02","Alright, thats both keycards. Let's open that vault up."
"pln_cs1_06_03","Beautiful stacks of unmarked Benjamins. Just reward for an honest heister."
"pln_cs1_07_02","Don't make plans for that cash just yet. Remember we need to get it to the blackmailing asshole first. Don't worry, we'll find him."
"pln_cs1_09_02","A great haul, gang. Another top job."
"pln_cs1_101_02","Just hold them off a little longer, gang. I'm finding you a way out."
"pln_cs1_103_06","Keep the people down. Keep them quiet."
"pln_cs1_109_02","Protect the cage. These cops have no respect for your honest work and can take the bags."
"pln_cs1_111_02","Ah! The cage was empty. Did you let the cops snag it back? Nevermind. You guys are just gonna have to mule it out the old-fashioned way."
"pln_cs1_112_02","Grab those bags, guys."
"pln_cs1_116_01","You got one minute til that Captain raises the alarm."
"pln_cs1_118_01","The vault is protected by a laser gate, but no matter. You know what to do. Watch its sequence and time your run through."
"pln_cs1_119_02","We will make actioning that our top priority. Thank you."
"pln_cs1_122_01","Roberts Bank."
"pln_cs1_12_03","Now let it do it's thing, and remember to keep the cops off it."
"pln_cs1_15_01","OK, we're in. Get in that vault, start moving the loot out!"
"pln_cs1_16_01","Getting the money is fine, but your priority has to be assembling the skyhook. Look for the pieces of the cage and get it built."
"pln_cs1_16_03","Remember, if you don´t get that cage assembled we can't move the cash. Get it done!"
"pln_cs1_18_03","The roof is the target for the plane, so the cage needs to be built there."
"pln_cs1_20_01","Find the bags for the cage, and get them to the parking lot."
"pln_cs1_20_02","The plane will collect the cage from the parking lot, so get these bags there and get building."
"pln_cs1_25_03","OK, gang, good. Now hold on."
"pln_cs1_26_02","Dammit! The plane missed the cable. Alright. Still time for another pass. Stand by."
"pln_cs1_27_01","Bullseye! That was some flying! Now get out of there."
"pln_cs1_29_03","No worse than being locked in a van with Wolf's ass on semi-automatic. Find the exit."
"pln_cs1_33_02","That's the alarm. No more tip-toeing, gang. It's all about speed and violence now. "
"pln_cs1_34_01","Well, so much for stealth. But the job's half done. Just get that money out of there."
"pln_cs1_35_01","That's the alarm, but we got enough out of there."
"pln_cs1_39_02","Plane is coming in hot. He'll collect from the roof. Make sure everything is ready."
"pln_cs1_49_01","Gang. GenSec need the time lock codes. I'll stall them as long as I can. Can you see them?"
"pln_cs1_49_02","Can any of you see the time lock codes. I can't stall them for long."
"pln_cs1_50_01","Today's code is 559732. Sorry it took so long."
"pln_cs1_57_01","Almost there, gang. Any second now."
"pln_cs1_65_02","You're going to have DC's finest crawling up your ass. Cops on the scene."
"pln_cs1_66_01","Crap. That's GenSec. Get ready to deal with them."
"pln_cs1_75_01","Gang, that's a heavy SWAT van that just rocked up. Be ready."
"pln_cs1_77_02","Good job assembling the cage. Can you do as good filling it?"
"pln_cs1_78_01","Don't stand around. Start working on those deposit boxes."
"pln_cs1_81_01","Watch your heads, guys. Ass bombs aren't the only thing dropping into here."
"pln_cs1_81_03","It's about to get hot down there, gang. They're dropping grenades."
"pln_cs1_82_02","That red ladder will let you get onto the roof."
"pln_cs1_82_03","An access ladder, with the hatch unlocked. These sloppy assholes deserve to be robbed."
"pln_cs1_91_01","Eight bags. Out-fucking-standing. "
"pln_cs1_cnc_03","Let's strike a counter or two. Bag up a bank."
"pln_cs1_end_03_03","Crap hit the fan - well, crap hit everything, judging by the stink off you. I'll call in a cleaner crew for the evidence left behind."
"pln_csod_01_05","The drill is down - cops all over it."
"pln_ctci_01_04","Get the people on the floor. Keep 'em down."
"pln_dah_01_01","Remember, stay low, stay dark. And stay quiet. Here we go."
"pln_dah_03_04","Walls and router boxes. They go together like trouble and badges."
"pln_dah_04_03","There's a router box right near you."
"pln_dah_05_01","Great, now you just need to find the second one."
"pln_dah_05_02","That's one box down, one to go."
"pln_dah_06_03","I'll have the system down in a bit."
"pln_dah_08_02","Shouldn't be too much longer."
"pln_dah_100_01","Bag those stones and get them to the garden. Get them out with ziplines."
"pln_dah_100_03","Use ziplines to get the bags out via the garden."
"pln_dah_101_01","Set up a zipline to speed things up."
"pln_dah_101_02","You can do it faster if you set up a zipline."
"pln_dah_103_02","Guys, I have to pull the chopper out until things cool down."
"pln_dah_104_01","Ok, guys. Chopper is back so get to loading again!"
"pln_dah_105_03","Almost there!"
"pln_dah_106_02","You're all done. Get to the roof and signal the chopper if you're ready to leave!"
"pln_dah_109_07","What're you still doing there? Get on the helicopter."
"pln_dah_112_03","OK, that computer had a piece of code to the vault on it, but to be able to use it, you need the other parts as well. They're probably around there somewhere. "
"pln_dah_113_01","Don't loose that keycard, you're gonna need it later."
"pln_dah_115_03","Hey, Ralph is still there. Be ready to grab him."
"pln_dah_116_01","The CFO is still there. Keep your eyes open."
"pln_dah_15_01","Third one found."
"pln_dah_22_01","You'll probably find a computer in Administration."
"pln_dah_22_02","Have a look in the Admin Office, there's bound to be a PC there."
"pln_dah_24_01","Go check the Velvet Room for a laptop. Just don't stick to the walls."
"pln_dah_28_02","See if someone in Management forgot their computer."
"pln_dah_29_01","Sales-people always have laptops."
"pln_dah_39_03","If you get the code order wrong, all hell will break loose."
"pln_dah_40_04","The vault isn't going anywhere. It's waiting for tha keycard and code."
"pln_dah_40_05","How far along are you on the vault? Use the card first, then enter the code."
"pln_dah_44_03","Get to the platorm with the bags!"
"pln_dah_46_01","That's probably worth a small fortune."
"pln_dah_47_02","I'd get that second vault open if I were you."
"pln_dah_47_03","Try to get that second vault open if you can."
"pln_dah_55_08","You looking to rent an office? What's the delay?"
"pln_dah_57_03","We need a change of plan, the code has been shut down!"
"pln_dah_59_02","OK, forget about staying low and quiet. Gimme a moment to think of something."
"pln_dah_62_02","Change of plan! You have to use ziplines instead to secure the bags!"
"pln_dah_62_03","The window cleaning platform is a no-go. Use ziplines to get the bags out instead. "
"pln_dah_65_02","No time to stop and party, find those routers ASAP!"
"pln_dah_65_04","Still waiting on those routers."
"pln_dah_66_02","That's one, find the next!"
"pln_dah_67_02","Ok, let me see..."
"pln_dah_69_01","Keep those routers safe."
"pln_dah_69_05","Keep them off the routers."
"pln_dah_70_02","50 percent done."
"pln_dah_72_01","OK, now you need that keycard. Find our birthday boy Ralph, he's probably still hiding somewhere!"
"pln_dah_75_03","You still need to find the master code!"
"pln_dah_80_01","Swipe Ralph's card before entering the code."
"pln_dah_81_02","Listen up, the code is..."
"pln_dah_85_01","Three"
"pln_dah_90_01","Eight"
"pln_dah_92_01","Repeat, the code is..."
"pln_dah_92_07","Forget the code? It's..."
"pln_dah_94_01","Vault is opening. Get ready to move!"
"pln_dah_94_02","Be ready for a smash-and-grab!"
"pln_dah_96_02","A second vault?"
"pln_dah_98_02","Open that second vault and you'll get a juicy bonus."
"pln_dah_98_03","Get that red diamond and this'll be a double payday."
"pln_dah_99_03","You came for the ones in cases, but everything else is a bonus."
"pln_dah_brf_01","Ok, listen up. To get inside that vault you need to get by the security system. Intel says that Garnet's son Ralph has the keycard for it, but he also happens to be the birthday boy so that could be a problem. There's also a three-part security code split up onto different laptops because someone told 'em it would be safer. It'd be great if you could get your hands on both the keycard and code without raising any alarms, maybe pull a silent fast one on Mr. Garnet."
"pln_dah_cnc_03","Hope you've had a good nights sleep, 'cause we're going after some diamonds. "
"pln_dd_01_03","No cops on the drill, guys!"
"pln_dn1_03_01","What? We didn't lay a damn thing. How is that possible?"
"pln_dn1_03_03","Bang on target, gang!"
"pln_dn1_06_03","All right, the truck is through there. Grab the C4 from the bin and blow that door."
"pln_dn1_07_02","Remember to grab the C4. That is your way through the door."
"pln_dn1_09_01","Guys, get the truck down! Shoot away those wires."
"pln_dn1_11_03","C4 those truck doors, gang. Hurry!"
"pln_dn1_12_01","The gold is inside the safe. No time to waste now. Set up the drill and drill it open."
"pln_dn1_12_03","Crack that safe, guys. Get that gold out of the firezone."
"pln_dn1_17_01","Remember: set fire to the tires. Get gas all over them!"
"pln_dn1_19_02","The helicopters are flying away. It's working."
"pln_dn1_20_01","Container 12. Lay a nice trap to cover our escape."
"pln_dn1_20_03","To cover our escape, you gotta set a fire trap in container 12. Use gas."
"pln_dn1_21_01","Okay. Now get it over by our exit. Use the control panel."
"pln_dn1_24_03","Gotta get the container with the gold loaded on the truck. The crane can do it."
"pln_dn1_29_03","Run! Run!"
"pln_dn1_32_03","You're reading my mind. We're going to need that gas later."
"pln_dn1_33_01","SWATs are spreading all over the roof. Look up guys."
"pln_dn1_33_03","Guys, guys! The garage doors. Murkies!"
"pln_dn1_34_01","As expected, they've got helicopters. A smokescreen will force them away."
"pln_dn1_38_02","We can't go lifting the container while you're inside there. Follow the plan!"
"pln_dn1_39_01","The van's stuck up there! Plant the C4 on the bottom, blow it open."
"pln_drk_02_01","Find your way inside and locate the Murkywater trains. The EMP parts will most likely be in different wagons."
"pln_drk_04_01","Okay, now you need to look for the actual Murkywater trains."
"pln_drk_05_02","Only way to get the doors open is by hacking the panel. Find it."
"pln_drk_13_03","You need to actually use the keycard, you know?"
"pln_drk_15_01","We're in a train yard, there should be tools laying around somewhere. See what you can find. A blowtorch would be perfect."
"pln_drk_17_02","Great, you actually found a blowtorch. Head back to the train and get through that door."
"pln_drk_18_03","Get back to the security door and get it open using the blowtorch."
"pln_drk_22_03","Now that you got your hands on some thermite, we can easily melt the bars on the gate."
"pln_drk_28_03","Head back to the vault door and plug in the hard drive. I'll take care of the rest."
"pln_drk_30_01","That crowbar will increase our chances of getting additional loot before we leave."
"pln_drk_32_01","Gang, we still need to get the EMP."
"pln_drk_32_02","Get back to the trains and get the EMP."
"pln_drk_35_01","Okay, the EMP has been secured, which is what we came for. But there is still time to head back and get additional loot if you feel up for it."
"pln_drk_36_01","Listen up, gang. I'm sending in a boat to pick you up. Look for the small water access near the river."
"pln_drk_45_03","Have you checked between the actual trains?"
"pln_drk_46_01","Gang, I want a sweep of the whole area. That means checking all corners of the train yard. Don't leave any stone unturned."
"pln_drk_46_03","There's four of you, guys. Spread out if needed and check all corners of the train yard."
"pln_drk_47_02","Looks like the EMP isn't here, but there might be some other valuable loot for us. You can either check it now or come back later."
"pln_ed1_01_01","OK, make your way inside. Keep it quiet. "
"pln_ed1_02_01","Alright. You're in. Now hunt around. There's gotta be a clue about which truck is carrying the voting machines to Washington. Search containers, check computers - anything you can to figure out the right truck."
"pln_ed1_04_01","They've seen you! The trucks are moving out. Alright, we need a Plan B. Lemme think."
"pln_ed1_05_01","OK, let's try this. Find something connected to the dock's network. I should be able to pull up their shipping manifests. Might have some clue about where they're headed."
"pln_ed1_08_02","You got the whole database. Great work. Absolute badasses!"
"pln_ed1_09_01","That terminal is showing which truck is going where. Keep checking. It might help pinpoint our truck."
"pln_ed1_10_02","They cut the power to the network. You need to get it back on."
"pln_ed1_14_01","There have to be clues around the wharf that'll help you figure out which truck is carrying the machines to Washington. Keep your eyes peeled."
"pln_ed1_14_03","There should be clues around to help you figure out the truck. Get Sherlocking. Look for open containers, they might indicate what the trucks are carrying."
"pln_ed1_16_02","One of these is the truck carrying the voting machines to Washington. When you think you know which one it is, get the tracker on it and we can move on."
"pln_ed1_99_01","C'mon guys, let's change the change!"
"pln_ed1_intro_a_01","Pier 39. Tag the truck carrying the voting machines to Washington, and get back here. Let me stress, we're only here for the truck."
"pln_ed2_02_01","You're in. Now, the target is the voting machines. They're likely in shipping crates, so look around for those."
"pln_ed2_02_03","Your next target is the voting machines. I'll bet they're stored in sealed crates. You clowns will need to improvise to open them."
"pln_ed2_07_03","The machine's done. That should make The Elephant happy. Now close up the crate and keep going."
"pln_ed2_09_03","That's the alarm. MPD response channels just went crazy. OK, no matter. Keep hacking those machines."
"pln_ed2_13_01","Get to that security room and boost that footage! There's no time to waste."
"pln_ed2_18_01","Hold them off until we get that footage."
"pln_ed2_intro_a_02","That's the depot where the machines are kept. Move out, you clowns."
"pln_ed3_04_01","OK, that's the server. Get the scrambler on there. "
"pln_ed3_10_03","There goes the wall. Now go on in."
"pln_ed3_13_02","The vault is open. This charade is almost done. Bag some money!"
"pln_ed3_23_06","Still good. Still good."
"pln_ed3_99_01","C'mon guys, let's change the change!"
"pln_election_stage1_06_any_01","Great that's it. Let's get out of here and find out if that's the right truck."
"pln_election_stage2_08_any_01","The hacking device needs to be rebooted to continue."
"pln_election_stage2_08_any_03","The hacking device you supposedly fixed is jammed again. You need to reboot it."
"pln_election_stage2_intro_a_01","OK. Go in, find the right truck and then the ballot machines. Once you do, reprogram them to swing votes and head back with the GenSec loot. This is two heists in one. Enjoy."
"pln_election_stage2_intro_a_02","Find the truck from the harbor and get inside. Reprogram the machines without anyone seeing you. Hit the GenSec van to smokescreen what happened. Cops in this town aren't the sharpest, after all."
"pln_election_stage3_05_any_01","The scrambler just crashed again. Fix it!"
"pln_election_stage3_06_any_01","Alright, the data scrambling is done. It'll just look like a simple hard drive failure. "
"pln_election_stage3_11_any_01","Get inside the vault and see what's inside!"
"pln_election_stage3_11_any_02","The vault's open, time to see what's inside!"
"pln_election_stage3_12_any_01","Oh no! The vault is damn near empty! Just get out of there!"
"pln_election_stage3_16_any_01","If the cameras are giving you a hard time, you should be able to get rid of the surveillance operator. He's in the security office on the upper floor..."
"pln_election_stage3_end_b_02","Well we didn't get rich on this job but the Elephant is OK with it. Next job we'll do better. "
"pln_esc_01_to_departure_heli","Hurry up! It's just one minute until take off!"
"pln_esc_05_to_arrival","Your ride will be there in about five minutes."
"pln_esc_arrival_van","Alright the van is there. Move!"
"pln_esc_cafe_01_to_departure_01","You've only got one more minute. Get the loot to the subway entrance and get the hell out of there!"
"pln_esc_cafe_warn_timelimit_subway_01","You won't have much time to escape, so be ready to move towards the subway station."
"pln_esc_fixed_heli","Guys, I've secured a chopper to get you out. Stay put!"
"pln_esc_fixed_van","Alright, guys! A van is coming in to get you out!"
"pln_esc_garage_03_any_01","OK look around - find the escape van!"
"pln_esc_park_marksmen_building_01","Watch out, they are deploying SWATs inside a nearby building."
"pln_esc_pep","Keep it together! You can't fall apart now!"
"pln_esc_requirement_07_bags","Remember guys, we need seven bags to escape."
"pln_esc_street_snipers_deployed_01","A police chopper is coming in to drop off snipers on a nearby building."
"pln_ff3_07_any_03","I get why the Elephant wants this. It is tons of gold in this deal!"
"pln_ff3_16_any_01","1600 Penn, maybe we go there for our next big score."
"pln_firestarter_stage1_brief_01b","Preferably take them as the money will be great that way."
"pln_firestarter_stage1_end_b_01","You don't let me down. Hector will be proud of this work. We are in business for real."
"pln_firestarter_stage2_08_any_01","It's alarmed, so don't open it yet. we need to disable the alarm first."
"pln_firestarter_stage2_14_any_01","...There's 3 GenSec security boxes we need to disable."
"pln_firestarter_stage2_15_any_01","...There's 2 GenSec security boxes we need to disable."
"pln_firestarter_stage2_19_any_01","2 remaining."
"pln_firestarter_stage2_end_a_02","Terrific. Because of you we know where all the Mendoza cash is stashed. It's one of the Trustee branch banks. I guess you know what comes next, huh?"
"pln_firestarter_stage3_01_any_01","OK guys, get into the bank and find the vault and drill it open. Make sure no one triggers the alarm or escapes."
"pln_firestarter_stage3_04_any_01","That should do it, you can place the drill now."
"pln_firestarter_stage3_05_any_01","Excellent! Keep that drill going."
"pln_firestarter_stage3_13_any_01","The surveillance guard triggered the alarm."
"pln_firestarter_stage3_intro_a_02b","Hector needs footage to show the world and, well, for our own safety."
"pln_fish_02_03","There's a laptop with info on where the cash is stashed. Charon provided the password. See if you can find it!"
"pln_fish_03_04","Where's that laptop? Found it yet?"
"pln_fish_04_03","Ok, that's the laptop. Good job!"
"pln_fish_10_01","That's the third stash. Only one left!"
"pln_fish_12_02","If you throw the loot bags into the sea, you can pick them up when it's time to leave."
"pln_fish_13_02","Secure the loot bags in the motorboat you arrived in."
"pln_fish_15_01","Use the zipline to secure the loot."
"pln_fish_16_03","That's all the cash secured. Now for the server with the bank passwords - get back to that laptop and hook me up so I can open the server room's security lock."
"pln_fish_17_02","Ok, connect me and I'll have this done in a few seconds."
"pln_fish_18_02","Ok, that's the server room door opened."
"pln_fish_19_01","Ok, I got the doors. But they won't open until the ECM jammer stops."
"pln_fish_23_03","Watch the heat rise. You'll get that reboot."
"pln_fish_25_02","Check two overrides, two more to go."
"pln_fish_25_03","Check two overrides, two more to go."
"pln_fish_28_02","There might be more loot on the yacht, but you got what you came for. Your choice."
"pln_fish_30_02","That's the alarm! The server room's locked down now - we can't access it!"
"pln_fish_33_01","You can throw bodies into the sea over the railing at the back of the boat."
"pln_fish_34_03","I'm sure glad most of the party is upstairs so we can work in peace and quiet down here."
"pln_fish_36_03","An active ECM jammer will make it harder to access the server room. So use them with caution."
"pln_fish_end_02","I wonder if McKendrick will ever figure out who did this. In any case, he shouldn't have messed with us."
"pln_fish_end_03","That's the end of McKendrick's re-election dreams - you're true kingmakers, guys! The Payday Gang giveth and it taketh away."
"pln_fish_intro_02","Be careful now, don't let the guards see you. And find that cash."
"pln_fj1_03_02","That's what we are after. Get it to the van."
"pln_fj1_08_03","That's our van coming back. Get ready, he is coming in!"
"pln_fj1_09_02","Those are all the bags we need but you guys know the drill, if you want more - stay and get more!"
"pln_fj1_10_02","Oh, that safe looks like it could hold some etra loot for us. Get it open!"
"pln_fj1_12_02","Guys, three bags, that's what we need."
"pln_fj1_13_01","Remember, we need six bags!"
"pln_fj1_brf_01_03","Scout the place and hit them hard. Get those jewels and keep the civs at bay. Let's get rich!"
"pln_fj1_end_01_01","Real professional gentlemen! They don't even know what hit them!"
"pln_fj1_end_01_02","That's how the pro's do it! Awesome work gentlemen!"
"pln_fj1_intro_01_03","Here we are, get in there and get me required amount. We go in quiet and go out with a boom!"
"pln_flt_02_01","Go inside."
"pln_flt_03_03","The bouncer will get suspicious if you don't walk in."
"pln_flt_03_04","Come on. Get inside."
"pln_flt_03_06","Hurry up and go inside."
"pln_flt_04_03","Get in there and get the deal started."
"pln_flt_09_03","The panic is on the third floor. Get over there. "
"pln_flt_14_02","Use the key to open the red door."
"pln_flt_19_02","Remember to keep the saws running. They tend to jam."
"pln_flt_23_01","Did you catch that, gang? Bile will drop off the C4 on the roof in a couple of minutes."
"pln_flt_23_02","You heard the man. Bile will deliver the C4 to the rooftop in a couple of minutes."
"pln_flt_25_02","Come on, Bile, what the hell? Sorry about that, guys, you'll still have to pick up the C4 and place them all around the floors above the panic room."
"pln_flt_26_01","Pick up the C4 and then plant it on the floor right above the panic room."
"pln_flt_28_03","Excellent. Just the fifth floor and the roof left. Get going, guys."
"pln_flt_36_03","Good job, now get the hell away from there before it goes off."
"pln_flt_39_02","That's one hell of a hole! It's perfect!"
"pln_flt_41_01","Bile, you ready to come pick up the cargo?"
"pln_flt_42_01","The building is opening up like a swiss cheese! I suggest you go up a few floors to get a better tactical position."
"pln_flt_46_03","Go down to the basement door in the back alley!"
"pln_flt_47_01","Everybody, get down into the sewers!"
"pln_flt_49_03","Faster guys!"
"pln_fost_brf_02_02","Hit the stores in here. Vlad gave us a cash target - beyond that, it's yours."
"pln_fost_brf_03_02","Get the cash amount we agreed on and I'll send the driver. More than that is gravy."
"pln_fost_brf_04_01","Sound good? Let's go!"
"pln_fost_en_01_03","More money for us."
"pln_fost_ne_01_02","OK, keep looking."
"pln_fourstores_stage1_brief_01","Look, I know Vlad is nuts. But he's got a lot of connections and I have a good feeling about him having a line on some big jobs down the line. "
"pln_framing_stage1_04_any_01","Listen up, if you can get me access to the computer in the surveillance room I'll get it open."
"pln_framing_stage1_04_any_03","We don't have enough paintings yet! Can someone get me access to the computer in the surveillance room, fast? I'll get it open, don't you worry about your pretty little heads."
"pln_framing_stage1_06_any_01","Dammit! If you want everything open again, you're going to need to get into the surveillance room."
"pln_framing_stage1_07_any_02","We don't have the time to wait around - can't you find a way in? What about the roof?"
"pln_framing_stage1_09_any_02","Good, now we need at least 3 more just like this and you need to get them to the van. It's in the parking lot next to the gallery."
"pln_framing_stage1_10_any_03","Halfway there with the painting collection. Now just get the rest and we're home free."
"pln_framing_stage1_11_any_02","We have four now and four's what we need - now if you want to get more, your move."
"pln_framing_stage1_13_any_02","OK, OK, I'm done with the security hack, everything's unlocked."
"pln_framing_stage1_14_any_01","Good, with that guy out of the picture, no more cameras."
"pln_framing_stage1_16_any_04","They're blowing the wall!"
"pln_framing_stage1_brief_01","The senator loves to collect art - outsider art in particular. Lucky for us, the Capitol Art Gallery is hosting an exhibition this week."
"pln_framing_stage1_end_a_01","Welcome back, crew. Now we install the cameras in the pictures, trade them to the senator's guys and get a look on whoever this arms dealer is."
"pln_framing_stage1_end_b_02","You cleaned the joint out. Now we'll have perfect coverage in the senator's apartment. I'll ensure we get the surveillance equipment in the paintings and set up the trade."
"pln_framing_stage1_intro_a_01b","Anyway, find the paintings marked as sold and take them. We need at least four to be safe."
"pln_framing_stage2_02_any_02","Is someone going to get that? Can't start the trade until you do.."
"pln_framing_stage2_06_any_02","Bingo. Pick it up."
"pln_framing_stage2_06_any_03","OK, that's them calling."
"pln_framing_stage2_10_any_01","OK good, now there is a van waiting for you on the other side of that building. Go through, load up the car, and we're done for the day."
"pln_framing_stage2_16_any_01","That's the doors, they blocked off the doors! There's gotta be another way out!"
"pln_framing_stage2_17_any_02","Dammit does anyone have an ECM jammer - that's about the only thing that'll crack that door. Othewise you need another route."
"pln_framing_stage2_brief_01","OK, the cameras are installed in the paintings. We're ready. The senator's men are jumpy but ready to deal with us. So let's deal. Money for art."
"pln_framing_stage3_02_any_01","We need his phone, his tablet, his laptop and two external hard drives."
"pln_framing_stage3_04_any_01","I hope you got a lot of cameras. It'll make it easier for us to find all the devices."
"pln_framing_stage3_11_any_01","One more, keep looking."
"pln_framing_stage3_12_any_01","Two more, keep on searching."
"pln_framing_stage3_26_any_01","Good job, we are gone."
"pln_framing_stage3_28_any_01","Alright, vault is popped, but watch out for those lasers, they connect directly to the alarm"
"pln_framing_stage3_30_any_01","Use his computer again, be careful, they only go down for a small amount of time."
"pln_framing_stage3_40_any_01","They cut the power! Get it back up!"
"pln_framing_stage3_47_any_01","Whatever you do don't let the sons of bitches cut the power!"
"pln_framing_stage3_51_any_06","It's uploading... It's almost there."
"pln_framing_stage3_51_any_07","Christ... Is it buffering? Go faster! Why don't they have Google fiber... Goddam American broadband."
"pln_framing_stage3_53_any_01","Whenever you're ready, I want you on the roof, then we'll get you outta there with the zipline."
"pln_framing_stage3_brief_01","This is the senator's apartment. Nice neighborhood, high security though. He's already got the paintings hung, so our cameras are online and transmitting."
"pln_fri_02_02","Let's find the head of security. He should have what you need to get in - USB stick with security codes. He'll be wearing a green jacket."
"pln_fri_05_01","Great, now plug the usb into the computer. Look for a laptop, it should be near the house."
"pln_fri_06_01","Can't find the laptop? Check around the house - the garage maybe?"
"pln_fri_08_01","What... guys, protect the computer! "
"pln_fri_09_01","Wait.. what... they've got additional security blocks. You gotta disable them. Find a security switchboard and rewire the system."
"pln_fri_10_03","Hmm... there seems to be another switchbox. Find it and rewire it, same as the other one."
"pln_fri_11_01","Great, that should do it. Now try starting the computer again."
"pln_fri_11_03","Ok, got the switchboards fixed. You can start the computer again."
"pln_fri_13_01","That was harder than expected but we're go! You can enter the house now."
"pln_fri_14_01","Let's get inside, guys!"
"pln_fri_15_01","If we're gonna get into the boss' office, we need to open the rest of the house. Look for a switch or something."
"pln_fri_16_01","Ok guys, that did it! The house is open!"
"pln_fri_16_03","Great guys! No one keeps you out!"
"pln_fri_17_03","Hmm... Sosa's office seems to be locked up behind a separate security system.... hang on..."
"pln_fri_18_01","We need a new plan... this guy has really burrowed in... hmm..."
"pln_fri_19_02","Hmm, explosives won't work, it's too dangerous... let me see..."
"pln_fri_20_01","Umm... ok, destroy stuff. Got it."
"pln_fri_21_03","Let's burn his paintings. Gather them in a pile first."
"pln_fri_26_03","Now just wait for his reaction."
"pln_fri_32_02","Now wait for the winches to work. And make sure they're not interfered with."
"pln_fri_33_02","The winch seems to have jammed. Get it up and running again!"
"pln_fri_40_01","That's the head of security. He seems to be in the garden."
"pln_fri_40_02","Hey, there he is. Looks like he's in the garden area."
"pln_fri_40_03","That's the head of security. Hmm... he's in the garden I think."
"pln_fri_45_03","That's the head of security. Hmm... he's by the driveway I think."
"pln_fri_47_03","Find the mic recorder. It's gotta be there."
"pln_fri_48b_01","You hung up! That's the alarm!"
"pln_fri_48_05","Montezuma wants three oranges for breakfast."
"pln_fri_49_03","I got something to show you, boss. You'll want to see it for yourself."
"pln_fri_50_01","There should be a button or something that opens the safe. Look around."
"pln_fri_56_01","Guys listen carefully. Once you start making the call, you can't hang up. He will most likely sound the alarm, he is a paranoid one after all."
"pln_fs1_02_any_02","Come on let's get a move on."
"pln_fs1_04_any_01","Judging by the amount of bodies, this is the gear we are after."
"pln_fs1_11_any_02","Nice work boys."
"pln_fs1_13_any_01","See if you can find a way to destroy the weapons or bring them to the van."
"pln_fs2_02_any_02","Check your options boys. Going full frontal might sting badly."
"pln_fs2_04_any_01","Alright, locate the server room and get inside. There's no point in disabling the alarms now."
"pln_fs2_05_any_03","Alarm on that door guys. We need to take care of that first."
"pln_fs2_06_any_03","Door - check. Alarm off - check. Get in there boys."
"pln_fs2_11_any_01","Nicely done, now cut the other one."
"pln_fs2_12_any_03","Check. Alarm on that door is off. Get inside now."
"pln_fs2_14_any_01","You're inside? Good job, now there is only one more door between us and the server."
"pln_fs2_15_any_02","FBI is swarming guys - get that door open!"
"pln_fs2_17_any_02","OK, they locked the server. Get that barrier open."
"pln_fs2_17_any_03","FBI sure knows security. Get that barrier open."
"pln_fs2_19_any_01","Don't fuck up now, you are almost there!"
"pln_fs2_19_any_02","You guys are so close. Don't get sloppy now."
"pln_fs2_19_any_03","FBI is still sleeping. Keep this up boys. Carry that loot out of there..."
"pln_fs2_20_any_01","That's it, that's it. Go. Go!"
"pln_fs2_25_any_02","Close, close, close. OK, go full force guys!"
"pln_fs2_26_any_01","Damn it! We almost did it! Just get it to the van."
"pln_fs2_27_any_01","Sweet that is some good old loot..."
"pln_fs2_27_any_03","Is it all there? Nice - get what's yours."
"pln_fs2_28_any_02","Loot, loot loot. Nice find. I think this belongs to us."
"pln_fs2_29_any_01","They locked down the building!"
"pln_fs3_02_any_01","Holy shit! Looks like they've electrified the vault! Get to the generator on the roof and shut it off."
"pln_fs3_06_any_01","OK, while we wait for the money to burn you can open up some of those deposit boxes. Whatever we find in there is ours."
"pln_fs3_09_any_01","The van is right across the street."
"pln_fwb_01_01","Just walk straight into the bank."
"pln_fwb_09_02","See that copy machine? It has the goods should this caper go loud. But let's try and not let them happen, huh?"
"pln_fwb_12_01","Check the marked terminals, gang. We're looking for a code."
"pln_fwb_13_08","Give me a second to check..."
"pln_fwb_14_01","Account reports. But no codes. Try the next one."
"pln_fwb_14_03","Credit applications. Accepted! No codes though. Next one."
"pln_fwb_14_08","Credit score, eight-fifty! But no codes. Keep looking."
"pln_fwb_18_02","Now we need to get through the vault door. Two keycard terminals need to be activated, within a small window. Find two keycards."
"pln_fwb_19_04","How are you doing tracking down those two keycards?"
"pln_fwb_19_07","Those keycards can't have vanished. They're there somewhere."
"pln_fwb_20_02","That's the first keycard. Second one's gotta be here somewhere."
"pln_fwb_21_02","Okay, now you gotta use the first card in the security room, and then you gotta be quick to swipe the second on the panel by the vault door. "
"pln_fwb_22_02","And now the vault keypanel! Hustle!"
"pln_fwb_23_03","Damn! Okay, just try again."
"pln_fwb_24_02","And...open sesame!"
"pln_fwb_27_01","Once you've got your fill, throw the bags through that vent by the elevators. Don't worry. You'll see 'em again soon."
"pln_fwb_30_01","Find our Insider. She'll show you out."
"pln_fwb_32_03","Keep it quiet, gang, but keep it moving. Get down to the garage."
"pln_fwb_33_02","The garbage truck is waiting for the money bags, come on!"
"pln_fwb_34_03","And that is how you do it! Text book execution, gang! Congratulations!"
"pln_fwb_37_02","Got a drill and some thermite hidden in the copy machine in the server room. Go get it."
"pln_fwb_38_02","There's two cans of thermite there. One of you other guys grab it."
"pln_fwb_39_01","There's one more can of thermite in the copy machine. Maybe come back for it?"
"pln_fwb_39_02","There's two cans of thermite there. Maybe you can come back later?"
"pln_fwb_40_02","All right. Get that drill set up on the gate."
"pln_fwb_41_02","Gang, we're going nowhere until that drill is working."
"pln_fwb_43_02","OK guys - while the drill does the lock, we're going to deal with the gates' magnetic seal. Let me find a good terminal."
"pln_fwb_46_02","Nice! Go through the gate and head to the vault. Find the counting room and pour out the thermite. We're burning down to the vault!"
"pln_fwb_48_01","Great, now just hold the fort until the thermite is done."
"pln_fwb_53_01","Put the moneybag on the floor and grab some cash!"
"pln_fwb_56_02","Okay, great! Now stash that loot in the vent by the elevators!"
"pln_fwb_58_03","The lobby's too hot! Get upstairs!"
"pln_fwb_61_02","We're blasting out the back door. Get C4 on that wall!"
"pln_fwb_61_03","C4 that wall, gang! We're making our own escape route."
"pln_fwb_62_03","Through the hole, gang! You're getting out of there!"
"pln_fwb_67_02","This will be a high-profile catch if the cops drop us. Don't let it happen."
"pln_fwb_69_03","You poked out their eyes in the vault area. No more cameras back there."
"pln_fwb_cbf_01_01","We've been eyeing the First World Bank for a while. Now it's time to pull the trigger. Get down there and relieve them of their ill-gotten gains.$NL;$NL;» Locate the manager$NL;» Get access to the server room$NL;» Force your way to the vault$NL;» Bag all the money and escape"
"pln_gen_alm_01_02","They've spotted you!"
"pln_gen_alm_01_06","Alarm's tripped, plan B!"
"pln_gen_alm_01_08","Time to adapt, new plan!"
"pln_gen_alm_01_13","Time to get your feet wet!"
"pln_gen_alm_01_18","OK, don't panic, you're professionals!"
"pln_gen_alm_01_19","This is the hard part, plan B. Good luck!"
"pln_gen_alm_02_04","Mask up when you're ready to roll."
"pln_gen_alm_02_07","I like what I'm seeing in there."
"pln_gen_alm_02_11","Keep it rolling people."
"pln_gen_alm_02_17","They don't know you're there."
"pln_gen_att_01_03","Units inside!"
"pln_gen_att_05_02","In the building!"
"pln_gen_bagit_01_02","Put it in bags and move it out!"
"pln_gen_bfr_01_01","Van's here! Saying again, escape van's here!"
"pln_gen_bfr_10_02","You're on the clock guys!"
"pln_gen_bgst_01_03","They stole the bags!"
"pln_gen_bgst_01_04","They are stealing our bags!"
"pln_gen_count_07_01","That's seven."
"pln_gen_count_08_01","That's eight."
"pln_gen_count_11_01","Nice, that's a quarter!"
"pln_gen_count_15_01","Just two more!"
"pln_gen_dir_06_01","Behind you!"
"pln_gen_fbo_01_05","You keep it up and we're golden."
"pln_gen_gen_01_01","Keep the people in check..."
"pln_gen_gen_01_05","Close... Come on folks... Getting there."
"pln_gen_gen_01_18","Bang that gong folks."
"pln_gen_gen_01_24","You believe in fate?"
"pln_gen_gen_01_36","Crime is for closers, people."
"pln_gen_lkgo_01_10","So far so good... Very good."
"pln_gen_lkgo_01_13","Keep it up and we're going to pull it off."
"pln_gen_lkgo_01_21","Just like I thought it would go."
"pln_gen_pol_01_12","Police on the scene!"
"pln_gen_pol_01_14","Well here come the damn cops!"
"pln_gen_pol_02_01","They're deploying SWAT units, Get ready to face some heavy firepower."
"pln_gen_snip_01_08","Snipers just got activated. Stay sharp."
"pln_gen_snip_01_09","Yeah, they just put snipers into play."
"pln_gen_snip_02_05","Yeah chatter sounds like they're activating sniper teams. Get low."
"pln_gen_snip_04_02","Sniper... building!"
"pln_gen_snip_05_01","Yeah I see snipers on the roof now... Look out."
"pln_gen_snip_06_01","Sniper! Interior!"
"pln_gen_urg_01_03","Come on guys! Go!"
"pln_gen_urg_01_04","Move it, move it!"
"pln_gen_urg_01_06","They're coming!"
"pln_gen_urg_01_08","Shit, here they come!"
"pln_gen_wsd_01_02","Keep them away from the drill!"
"pln_gen_wsd_01_13","This is it! THIS IS IT!"
"pln_gen_wsd_01_16","I didn't team up to lose! "
"pln_gen_wsd_01_26","You're going to make it... Just think of the money!"
"pln_gen_wsd_01_28","Keep 'em off the drill!"
"pln_gen_wsd_01_30","Your job is to make them go down without a goddam fight!"
"pln_glc_01_01","Ok, get in there and get our man out."
"pln_glc_04_06","Go find those trucks."
"pln_glc_06_01","Alright, we don't know which prison transport our man is in, so you'd better place a saw on each one of the four trucks!"
"pln_glc_07_04","Get those transports opened up!"
"pln_glc_07_07","Saw those trucks open and find him!"
"pln_glc_08_02","That's the first one opened - have a look inside!"
"pln_glc_08_03","One truck opened! Check inside!"
"pln_glc_09_02","That's the second one opened - have a look inside!"
"pln_glc_10_01","Third transport is open - check inside!"
"pln_glc_11_03","That's the last one opened! Check it!"
"pln_glc_13_02","You can go for the cash after you find the primary target."
"pln_glc_15_08","Come on guys, get the prisoner to the tower!"
"pln_glc_16_04","Get the prisoner, don't leave him behind!"
"pln_glc_18_02","You can throw the loot in the yellow waste chute hanging on the side of the construction tower. I'll have someone pick it up later."
"pln_glc_18_03","See the yellow waste chute on the side of the construction tower? You can throw the loot in there and I'll have someone pick it up later."
"pln_glc_20_01","Ok, release the balloon!"
"pln_glc_24_03","That's another attack helicopter guys! Stay sharp!"
"pln_glc_29_03","Ok guys, time to leave the tower and get out of here. Move along the bridge!"
"pln_glc_30_02","Time to split! To the right and down the stairs. Go!"
"pln_glc_32_02","Watch it! Don't let the cops take the balloon down!"
"pln_glc_intro_02","Cover your ears now...."
"pln_hb1_01_02","When you're ready, give the driver the signal."
"pln_hb1_01_03","Driver's waiting on your signal, gang."
"pln_hb1_04_03","Car's blocking the truck. Move it!"
"pln_hb1_05_01","Damn SWAT van's blocking the route. Move it!"
"pln_hb1_06_02","Must be some way to build across those roadworks."
"pln_hb1_07_02","Stingers on the road. Get them out of the way."
"pln_hb1_09_01","Come on, gang! Get the truck moving again!"
"pln_hb1_10_01","Collect the ticket. Open the gate."
"pln_hb1_12_03","Control room has to be here somewhere!"
"pln_hb1_15_02","Reboot the hack. And keep the cops off it!"
"pln_hb1_16_03","Alright, look's like it's working again. Great."
"pln_hb1_17_02","Into the system. Now just press the button and drop those bollards!"
"pln_hb1_20b_03","Feel the need for speed, gang. Strip the armor off the truck. "
"pln_hb1_25_01","Get Hoxton up to the street. Get him to the safe house!"
"pln_hb2_01_02","Good. Now get those keys back to Hox."
"pln_hb2_03_01","Right, that's the files. Get them back to Hoxton!"
"pln_hb2_05_02","Great. Now haul it back up to the Operations Room."
"pln_hb2_06_01","Escort whoever is carrying that server. It's gonna be heavy, and I think the cops will try to liberate it from you."
"pln_hb2_07_01","Get inside the Evidence Room and find evidence related to Hoxton's case."
"pln_hb2_08_03","Christ, don't they organize this stuff. Search through it. Find that evidence. You're looking for evidence that's related to Hoxton."
"pln_hb2_09_02","Now take the evidence to the lab. If we can find some DNA that belongs to the traitor, we might be able to pinpoint who he is."
"pln_hb2_10_02","Damn, their system didn't allow us to see who the DNA belongs to. Still, we have a sample of the traitor's DNA, I'm sure we can put it to good use. Now get back to Hoxton."
"pln_hb2_12_01","Keep defending Hoxton! If things are getting hairy, use cards to override the security barriers."
"pln_hb2_12_02","Defend Hoxton. If you have cards, you can seal off the entrances."
"pln_hb2_16_02","They're not getting in that way!"
"pln_hb3_01_02","We're here. Nice night for a murder."
"pln_hb3_02_01","There's the house. And, somewhere in there, the rat."
"pln_hb3_03_03","Your first job is getting beyond the perimeter."
"pln_hb3_04_01","Look out for ways to get in. Has to be some weak point in the security. Get a close look at that fence."
"pln_hb3_07_01","Look in through the windows and try to find the alarm box. You'll have a limited time to disable it once you're inside, so it's best to be prepared."
"pln_hb3_08_01","You just triggered the countdown! Find and disable the alarm before it's timer runs out!"
"pln_hb3_10_02","Into the mansion! Hustle!"
"pln_hb3_11_03","Our target will be in the panic room. Look for it. Once you've found it, we can work on winkling that traitor bastard out."
"pln_hb3_16_02","That door needs two keycards to open AND has a retinal scanner. Should be easy."
"pln_hb3_18_02","That door needs two keycards and a key. Start looking for them."
"pln_hb3_19_01","OK, OK. The code is likely in some email. Find an FBI computer and gain access to it."
"pln_hb3_20_01","Good, it's searching the computer now. Make sure no one spots the computer when it's active."
"pln_hb3_21_02","That's it! Get the code to the panic room!"
"pln_hb3_21_03","And... got it! Now, use the code on the panic room door!"
"pln_hb3_23_01","That's the pole. Shinny up there."
"pln_hb3_24_02","Alright. Get access to the comms. We're gonna make a call."
"pln_hb3_26_01","Yes, hi, this is Agent Dave from the safe house. I need to talk with the informant urgently, requesting today's code. Sorry, didn't get my coffee this morning."
"pln_hb3_28_03","You'll need the FBI boss to get past the retinal scanner. Find him. Lead him there."
"pln_hb3_29_01","Now, take him to panic room so he can use the retinal scanner. Should work."
"pln_hb3_31_01","OK, now we need two keycards. Use both of them on the panic room door."
"pln_hb3_31_02","Now. We need keycards - two of em. Use em on the door."
"pln_hb3_35_01","Looks like we are doing this loud, gents! The panic room's locked down so we do this the hard way. Bile will get us a thermal lance. Hang on."
"pln_hb3_35_03","OK, we go loud! That panic room is secure, so you'll need a thermal lance to get through. It's on the way."
"pln_hb3_36_03","Stay alive. Bile will drop the lance soon."
"pln_hb3_37_02","There's the lance. Grab it, and let's burn that rat out of his panic room."
"pln_hb3_39_01","Put the thermal lance to good use and get the panic room open."
"pln_hb3_39_02","Get the thermal lance onto the panic room door."
"pln_hb3_42_02","Hector!? What the hell!? I always though the Firestarter job felt a bit weird. The Mendoza's, maybe they weren't the bad guys after all. I mean, sure, they were rotten apples, but this fucking rat was far worse."
"pln_hb3_42_04","Hector was the one working with the feds!? That son of a bitch thought he could play us for fools. In the end, he's the one who was crushed, that dirty Colombian rat."
"pln_hb3_43_01","OK, focus on the job. There's evidence scattered throughout the house. Need to take care of it, gotta make sure the FBI loses the scent!"
"pln_hb3_44_03","We could have used that guy. Ah well. Switch to the back up plan."
"pln_hb3_49_03","FBI Ready Teams are on their way! Those bastards were on standby in the nearby houses!"
"pln_hb3_50_03","Damn, snipers are setting up around the perimeter. Watch out and only go outside if you need to!"
"pln_hb3_52_03","Looks like the FBI boss is close to your position. Don't kill him, he might be useful."
"pln_hb3_53_03","For every bag of evidence you secure, I will provide compensation. Crime.net needs to be protected."
"pln_hb3_54_02","An inside contact has rigged up spy cameras and surveillance drones. You can access them from the gadget on the roof."
"pln_hb3_54_03","An FBI connection of mine has rigged the place with spy cameras and has set up surveillance drones outside. You can control them from the gadget on the roof."
"pln_hb3_55_01","Damn! The timelock has jammed. Your ECM jammers must be interfering with it! Wait for it to resume."
"pln_hb3_56_02","What?!! You let the FBI boss slip away? He's left the scene! Well, he's not coming back. Gotta switch to plan B."
"pln_hb3_57_01","Damn! The Alarm timer ran out. It's not rocket science, people!"
"pln_hb3_58_02","The alarm has been activated and it's ticking down. Take care of it before it reaches 0!"
"pln_hd1_02_01","OK. If we're going to do this quietly, we need to disable some of these alarm systems. Look around. Search the museum. Find the circuit boxes that power security. If we can hack them, we can shut the place down without setting off the alarms."
"pln_hd1_04_01","Next step... Two time locks. You need keycards to get past each. Guards won't have 'em - but the civvie researchers probably will. Find and, y'know, persuade them. They'll give up their keycards soon enough."
"pln_hd1_05_01","Damn! The time locks are locked down. Keycard's aren't worth crap now. Time to brute force the security panels!"
"pln_hd1_05_02","Ah crap! There's the time lock. Forget the keycards. Force through those panels."
"pln_hd1_05_03","Rat! Time locks have kicked in. Alright. Forget keycards. We're going to force this."
"pln_hd1_10_03","Damn! Cops are sending everyone they got. Time to make this a blood diamond. Find security!"
"pln_hd1_11_02","Hey, where's the Diamond? They've lowered it into the floor! Wasn't expecting that. Calls for brutal method - break through with a drill!"
"pln_hd1_13_02","Keep the cops off the circuit box. Don't let them shut it down."
"pln_hd1_13_03","Protect that circuit box. The cops'll try to shut it down. Don't let 'em!"
"pln_hd1_14_02","That's gas! Get out of there!"
"pln_hd1_15_03","The gas will clear away. Give it a moment. "
"pln_hd1_16_01","OK, the gas is gone. Get back in there!"
"pln_hd1_21_03","Surveillance is blind. Cameras are out of action. Should make things easier."
"pln_hd1_26_01","Get a keycard and swipe it through the time locks. Check civvies for cards."
"pln_hd1_28_03","Always thought being a night-guard at a museum would be a great job. But, you know, the whole stealing thing..."
"pln_hd1_30_02","The Mongol's were great warriors. Would love to see them in action."
"pln_hd1_30_03","Supposedly, it was Genghis that found the Diamond. He did pretty well out of it."
"pln_hd1_31_02","This place gives me the heebie-jeebies."
"pln_hd1_33_02","Some nice loot in these displays. But some cheap counterfeit crap too. Look for alarms. That'll mark the good stuff."
"pln_hd1_34_02","Looks like every cop is headed your way! You're not driving out. Light a flare, and we'll get you an air extraction."
"pln_hd1_37_01","That was the wrong tile! "
"pln_hd1_39_02","Keep it quiet, gang."
"pln_hd1_39_03","They don't suspect a thing. This is great."
"pln_heli_01_04","Look up - police chopper in the sky!"
"pln_heli_01_06","Police are flying in - heads up!"
"pln_heli_02_04","Heads up our chopper is incoming!"
"pln_heli_03_03","We got a chopper landing on the roof."
"pln_heli_03_04","Chopper is bound for the roof."
"pln_hlp_01_01","Damn, what is this place?"
"pln_hlp_02_01","Let's find a way into the prison."
"pln_hlp_02_03","I think we need to get into the prison."
"pln_hlp_04_01","I don't think we have a choice. We have to spin that wheel!"
"pln_hlp_04_02","I don't like the look of the prizes on that wheel, but I think we have to spin it anyway."
"pln_hlp_06_01","It landed on sniper again. Get ready guys."
"pln_hlp_06_03","The wheel has decided, looks like we have some more snipers incoming."
"pln_hlp_08_02","Ok the wheel landed on flames again, watch out!"
"pln_hlp_10_03","Smoke incoming guys!"
"pln_hlp_11_01","Drills? Not sure what that is..."
"pln_hlp_11_02","The wheel stopped on drills. Do you guys know what that means?"
"pln_hlp_12_02","Watch out! It stopped on drills again!"
"pln_hlp_18_07","The timer is standing still. Get it going again!"
"pln_hlp_22_03","Now let's enter the prison. Use the keycard to open the door."
"pln_hlp_23_01","Time to see what the prison has in store for us."
"pln_hlp_24_02","There should be another wheel around here somewhere."
"pln_hlp_25_02","Let's see... Place the keycard in the panel and activate that switch. Hope we're not in for a big suprise..."
"pln_hlp_26_01","Place that keycard."
"pln_hlp_28_01","If you wanna leave, there's an escape panel on the top floor. Check it out if you wanna call it quits."
"pln_hlp_29_01","Same procedure as last time - grab the loot or leave this prison on the top floor."
"pln_hlp_31_01","See that timer over there? Hurry up if you wanna secure the loot!"
"pln_hlp_35_02","There's no turning back - get out of this goddamn place!"
"pln_hlp_36_01","We're taking the train - grab the zipline up to the bridge!"
"pln_hlp_38_02","What's that, extra loot? You sure you wanna do that?"
"pln_hm1_01_01","Busting up this motel is our first step to getting Hoxton free. Head in there."
"pln_hm1_03_01","Boom! That's the first."
"pln_hm1_10_01","The Commissars' guys've got some hot wheels. How about we make them a little hotter? Look around the gas station, there's gotta be something to burn."
"pln_hm1_12_02","A meth factory! Burn that place up. Or, if you can find a formula, get cooking. Can always move a little extra product."
"pln_hm1_15_03","Keep going, keep trashing!"
"pln_hm1_15_05","Like a bull in a china shop!"
"pln_hm1_16_05","Shame to see such fine wheels go up in smoke. But if it gets the Commissar's attention..."
"pln_hm1_17_02","Get in there, and just mess the place up. Trash the rooms, light up the cars - whatever you can do. Go crazy. The Commissar is bound to give us a call."
"pln_hm1_20_02","And... Got it! Well, looks like our Russian friend is somewhere in, hold on..."
"pln_hm1_22_01","Got him! Foggy Bottom!"
"pln_hm1_26_02","Look for something connected to that place."
"pln_hm1_29_01","That's a second hatch, guys. The Commissar must have something sweet."
"pln_hm1_30_03","Hey, maybe that hatch hides something that can help us locate the Commissar. I got an idea how we can crack it. Bile is bringing you something. "
"pln_hm1_32_03","That's the hatch! I've got an idea for it. Bile is going to be Santa, and since you're such good boys and girls..."
"pln_hm1_36_01","Is it working? Nice. But damn, that hatch is strong. "
"pln_hm1_39_02","Only one minute to go!"
"pln_hm1_44_02","Make sure the cops don't do that again. Keep it running!"
"pln_hm1_44_03","Good job, clowns. Keep the wheels burning."
"pln_hm1_47_01","We know he is in West End somewhere. Look around for anything related to it. Files, maps. Remember: West End."
"pln_hm1_47_02","The trace indicates West End. So look for a clue for that - West End."
"pln_hm1_47_03","We know the call originated in West End. Look for something to give us a precise address. West End."
"pln_hm1_48_02","The Commissar is bunkered down somewhere around Foggy Bottom. Find a clue for that place."
"pln_hm1_49_03","Our Russian friend is somewhere in Shaw, so find a clue for that. Remember, he's in Shaw."
"pln_hm1_51_02","No no no, that can't be correct. Get another barcode."
"pln_hm1_54_01","What's that? Russian loot? Get it to the DeLorean. Hurry!"
"pln_hm1_54_03","Russians got a bit of loot stashed around the place. Not going to make us rich, but every little helps."
"pln_hm1_56_03","Think the drill is finished, guys. Time to get into that basement."
"pln_hm1_58_03","Now get the cable on both the pick-up and the hatch."
"pln_hm1_60_02","Chopper on the scene, but it ain't the feds!"
"pln_hm1_62_01","Chopper's back on the scene! Watch out."
"pln_hm1_62_05","Is this D.C. or Grozny?"
"pln_hm1_63_01","Get to cover!"
"pln_hm1_63_03","It's firing! Get outta the way... Now!"
"pln_hm1_64_01","Remember - track down the mobsters. Track them down, and put them down."
"pln_hm1_67_04","Another mobster taken care of. Keep at it."
"pln_hm1_70_01","What the hell was that? Did they just blow up another entrance?"
"pln_hm1_70_02","Guys, I think the cops just shape charged another entrance!"
"pln_hm1_71_01","Remember: you're looking for a clue about Downtown Washington. A file, hint - anything. See where he is at."
"pln_hm1_77_01","Now just connect it to the hatch."
"pln_hm1_79_05","Think the Commissar got this thing from Vlad. Slow Russian junk..."
"pln_hm1_end_01_01","Alright, we got the address for where the Commissar's at. It's an old apartment complex. Place is a run-down dump. Hard to say what security you can expect. Suit up, and let's finish this."
"pln_hm1_intro_01_01","The Commissar is dug in tight as a tick. This is one of his operations. Wreak havoc. If you can smash this dump up enough, he should give us a call. Then I can trace him."
"pln_hm2_02_04","We need to put the Commissar in a wooden box. Not stay in one ourselves. Move!"
"pln_hm2_07_03","This is the penthouse level. Commissar has to be here."
"pln_hm2_10_01","That crafty bastard! He's using his vault as a panic room. Let me drop you a thermal drill."
"pln_hm2_10_02","A vault! The Commissar is pulling every string to keep his ass alive. I'm sending over a thermal drill."
"pln_hm2_11_03","Your drill is there. Get it started on that vault."
"pln_hm2_12_03","Commissar has called in the big guns. The very big guns. Stay away from that chopper!"
"pln_hm2_14_03","Fires are out. Nicely handled."
"pln_hm2_16_01","That's it. The Commissar is dead. We're one step closer to getting Hoxton back. I'm sending in a helicopter, so stay put. Good work up there."
"pln_hm2_16_02","He's dead. Good riddance. Chopper's on the way, guys. Dentist sent a few bottles of champagne with it. Sure Hoxton will be grateful too. Good work."
"pln_hm2_19_01","The good news: Commissar has a HUGE stash of coke up in his penthouse. The bad news: he's flushing it as fast as he can. That's a lot of money swirling down the crapper - the faster you get there, the bigger the bonus!"
"pln_hm2_20_06","I can't believe that Russian asshole is destroying that product. Get at it before it's all gone!"
"pln_hm2_20_08","They're flushing that coke away. Gang, get up there before it's all gone!"
"pln_hm2_20_09","They're wasting cocaine like Hollywood producers with fresh checks in there! Step on it!"
"pln_hm2_20_10","Powder's flying like it's a goddamn bakery in there - if you want in, you'd better book it!"
"pln_hm2_20_18","Keep pushing forward! This is a time limited offer if there ever was one!"
"pln_hm2_20_19","Throw in another gear, will ya? That pile of coke is getting smaller at an alarming pace!"
"pln_hm2_20_21","If you get up there fast enough, we'll make a fortune. Come on! Make an effort!"
"pln_hm2_21_03","Don't get caught up, get to the coke! They're not fooling around! Oh, my poor heart..."
"pln_hm2_21_10","That's another bag of coke. And another one... And... Should I keep going? It's heartbreaking."
"pln_hm2_22_05","Will you hurry up! All this coke going to waste, it's breaking my heart!"
"pln_hm2_24_01","Alright, anyway... Let's find the Commissar in his penthouse and kill him. That bastard's gonna pay."
"pln_hm2_24_03","Hm... That's sad, but we have not time to lose! Focus on the Commissar now - track him and whack him!"
"pln_hm2_26_03","Uh... Not exactly Wonderland, is it."
"pln_hm2_28_02","Looks like they haven't had time to get the wiring behind the wall. Find the switch."
"pln_hm2_29_02","Staircase's blocked. Gotta be another way up."
"pln_hm2_29_03","Not going up this way. Look around. Has to be another path."
"pln_hur_01_01","Clock's ticking, people! "
"pln_jewelrystore_stage1_cnc_01","I've got a line on a jewelry store that's just begging to be hit. Call me back."
"pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_03","Nice job snatching all those gems guys. I'll called ahead to my diplomatic contacts - they are hungry for this. Let's feed 'em."
"pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_06","DC now has a jewelry shortage - this is where we come in. Well done team!"
"pln_jr1_02_02","Hey guys, remember to find the crates Locke has left. They got a strobe on."
"pln_jr1_04_03","Locke sounds a bit...mad. We'd better do what he says."
"pln_jr1_08_02","Locke wants us to sabotage the radars. Better get to it."
"pln_jr1_09_03","Nicely done, guys. Locke transferred our cut. I don't know about this guy, yet, but let's see how things pan out with him."
"pln_jr2_01_01","Hurry, guys! Into the hold!"
"pln_jr2_04_01","Light that flare for Locke, crew."
"pln_jr2_intro_01_02","Hope you're okay up there, crew. Here's Locke."
"pln_jr2_intro_01_03","All right, guys. Here's Locke... Be careful up there."
"pln_jwl_03_any_01","We want at least two bags of jewels from this store. Understand?"
"pln_jwl_05_any_01","Greed is your guide. If you want it, go get it. "
"pln_jwl_09_any_01","Get those bags to the car."
"pln_jwl_11_any_02","That's enough for Vlad, but get more if you feel brave."
"pln_jwl_11_any_03","Plenty for Vlad - is it enough for us? Your call."
"pln_jwl_12_any_02","Amp it up guys - more!"
"pln_knk_jwl_a_05_any_02","That's 30 seconds till the van leaves."
"pln_knk_jwl_a_11_any_04","It has to be there, the tiara is there somewhere."
"pln_knk_jwl_a_13_any_01","OK, that's it. Get it to the escape van... Vlad will be pleased."
"pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_05","The getaway just left without you."
"pln_knk_jwl_a_16_any_02","Guys we're looking for a tiara, might be in a safe, gotta be inside though."
"pln_knk_jwl_a_16_any_04","Guys remember why you're there, we're looking for a tiara."
"pln_ko1b_02_02","Guess the vault is gonna be in a Murky shipping container. Get opening them."
"pln_ko1b_02_03","The vault will be packed for transport, so check those Murky shipping containers."
"pln_ko1b_03_01","Remember, check the Murkywater shipping containers for the vault."
"pln_ko1b_03_03","Guys, the vault - find it! Check the Murkywater containers."
"pln_ko1b_04_02","Patching in Vlad..."
"pln_ko1b_05_02","These vaults have one weakness. A failsafe will open the door if the temperature inside gets too high. Look around for crowbars in the warehouse, and jam them into the rear fans."
"pln_ko1b_06_01","Remember: you need to find crowbars and jam them into the vault's fans. They are most likely inside the warehouse."
"pln_ko1b_06_02","Look around for crowbars in the warehouse. Stick them into the vault's fans, and wait for thermodynamics to do the rest."
"pln_ko1b_10_03","Last fan disabled. Temperature is off the hook. The contents must be scorching!"
"pln_ko1b_13_01","Vlad, are you crazy! Nukes!?"
"pln_ko1b_18_02","We're done. Now bail! Leave Vlad with his nukes."
"pln_ko1b_intro_01_01","Feels like old times, huh?"
"pln_ko1_02_03","Keep an eye out for anything you can hustle out of there. The Murkywater containers are your best bet - get them open."
"pln_ko1_03_03","You're in the lair of the beast now, gang. Better loot, but bigger risk."
"pln_ko1_04_03","A nice stash of used dinars. Good find."
"pln_ko1_06_01","Damn, this gold was likely boosted from Saddam's palace!"
"pln_ko1_08_03","That was last seen in the Iraqi National Gallery. These guys are shameless."
"pln_ko1_09_01","Who knows what's on that server. Blueprints, records - maybe the password for Area 51."
"pln_ko1_11_02","People will pay fortunes for this ancient Babylonian shit."
"pln_ko1_12_02","Saddam had his enemies heads served on that platter."
"pln_ko1_14_01","Alright, that'll keep Gage sweet. You guys can cash this out now, or stay for more."
"pln_ko1_14_02","That'll do for Gage, but you can stay for more."
"pln_ko1_15_02","The main gate. Direct route, but might be watched. Maybe there're other ways in."
"pln_ko1_17_03","The van will leave in one minute. Make sure you're in it."
"pln_ko1_21_02","You're nearly done. Only one bag to go."
"pln_ko1_24_01","Gage has arranged for one of the dumpsters to be used to stash some loot. "
"pln_ko1_25_03","Gage's guy is in a nearby parking lot. Throw the loot over the wall to him."
"pln_ko1_26_03","Hustle! The murkies will notice that open vault!"
"pln_ko1_intro_01_02","Almost there, gang. Get those clown masks on."
"pln_ko1_intro_01_03","It's quiet out there tonight. Keep it that way."
"pln_mad_03_03","If you find a laptop at the computer station, I could use it to help you."
"pln_mad_06_02","Damn, they interrupted the hacking. Get it started again!"
"pln_mad_08_02","I bet you there are some explosives laying around here. See if you can find any."
"pln_mad_09_03","Place the C4."
"pln_mad_10_02","Take cover!"
"pln_mad_11_02","Perfect! They won't be able to use that anymore."
"pln_mad_12_01","Damn, the EMP crashed right through the roof of the lumber mill."
"pln_mad_12_02","God dammit, Bile... The EMP fell through the roof and is now inside the lumber mill instead of outside."
"pln_mad_13_01","Nice drop, Bile! Gang, the EMP is in the yard outside the lumber mill."
"pln_mad_19_01","The mercenaries interrupted the EMP charge! Every time that happens, the EMP is slowly discharged!"
"pln_mad_19_02","Shit, the mercenaries stopped the EMP charge! It's beginning to discharge!"
"pln_mad_21_03","The EMP is almost done, so listen up! This baby is powerful so don't be surprised if it breaks our communication among other things."
"pln_mad_22_02","The EMP took care of the magnetic lock, so you have free passage to the laboratory. Let's go!"
"pln_mad_23_01","Man, the EMP took out the whole factory it seems... Use your flashlights and find the X-ray device."
"pln_mad_23_02","We're going to need an X-ray device to get the data the Elephant needs."
"pln_mad_26_01","Good job, guys. That should get rid of the gas in the scanning room."
"pln_mad_28_01","Gang, you need to find the lead scientist."
"pln_mad_29_03","The lead scientist is dead? Shit. Without him we aren't getting past security... Well, I guess technically we don't need HIM, but rather HIS hand..."
"pln_mad_31_01","Yes, it worked. It doesn't seem to matter that the scientist was dead. Technology is cruel. Well, get started with the scanner."
"pln_mad_33_01","Alright, gang. You need to look for the test-subjects and get them to the scanner. They are supposed to look pretty much the same."
"pln_mad_36_01","Okay, scanning is under way. Now make sure it gets to finish without getting interrupted."
"pln_mad_36_03","Protect the X-ray device! Don't let the mercenaries get to it!"
"pln_mad_42_01","Okay, the data is being transferred to the server in the other room. You can either go and get it or stay and scan more bodies. I'm sure Jimmy can find use for it and that means more cash for us."
"pln_mad_46_03","That's right! I almost forgot: there is a briefcase in the laboratory. I'm gonna need you to get it, guys. It's important."
"pln_mad_48_02","Haha, you read my mind, guys. I do want that briefcase."
"pln_mad_50_03","Great, the server has been secured. Now Jimmy can shut up about it. We did our part. "
"pln_mad_53_03","Guys, search the spot where you landed. Bile has dropped some explosives for you."
"pln_mad_54_01","Excellent, you got the explosives. Now, plant them on the radar."
"pln_mad_56_02","We need to take that radar out of action. The missiles from the anti-air gun should do the work. See if you can use it."
"pln_mad_57_01","Bring those missiles over to the radar!"
"pln_mad_57_03","Hell yeah. Those missiles are perfect. Take them to the radar. "
"pln_mad_59_03","Excellent, gang. With the anti-air defenses gone, Bile can now drop the EMP close to the lumber mill."
"pln_mad_62_02","We can not leave without that briefcase! "
"pln_mad_63_03","How convenient, he won't run away now. Cut off his hand and bring it to the scanner."
"pln_mallcrasch_stage1_brief_01","Yep. You heard him right. Vlad is serious. We go into the mall, we destroy as much as we can. "
"pln_mallcrasch_stage1_end_a_02","Mall destruction: check. Pissed off police: check. Let's go get paid from old Vlad."
"pln_mallcrasch_stage1_end_a_04","OK we beat on this sorry mall enough for one day. Well done. Vlad has proven his point and I think we need to lay low for a bit after this."
"pln_mallcrash_stage1_05_any_01","OK, that's around 5000 dollars."
"pln_mallcrash_stage1_09_any_02","Two-Five-Zero-Zero-Zero, half way! Keep going!"
"pln_mallcrash_stage1_11_any_01","35 thousand dollars."
"pln_mallcrash_stage1_12_any_01","That's 40 thousand, only ten more to go!"
"pln_mallcrash_stage1_13_any_01","45 thousand."
"pln_mallcrash_stage1_13_any_02","Almost there guys, forty-five thousand."
"pln_mallcrash_stage1_14_any_01","50 grand, woah, is there anything left?"
"pln_mallcrash_stage1_15_any_02","You can stay and trash if you want, but the escape's coming soon!"
"pln_mallcrash_stage1_19_any_01","He'll be there soon!"
"pln_man_00a_01","The limo has arrived. Taxman is here."
"pln_man_03_02","There he is; the one in the white shirt is the Taxman. "
"pln_man_04_02","Attention gang, the corporation representative is close."
"pln_man_04_03","The customer is getting close, standby. "
"pln_man_09_03","I'll eavesdrop and tell you what's being said. "
"pln_man_10_01","I count four guys."
"pln_man_10_03","I see four guys. "
"pln_man_11_01","Okay, Taxman goes for the server - I think..."
"pln_man_15_03","That is the server, gang! 25 million dollars can be ours! Now we need to act. "
"pln_man_23_01","Perfect, I knew you could be trusted, Alex."
"pln_man_23_03","Excellent, Alex, knew you were the right man for the job. "
"pln_man_24_02","Guys! That's too early, what if the server isn't there?"
"pln_man_25_02","Put him down in the chair and get the codes out of him."
"pln_man_30_01","They're climbing up on the balcony straight from the front."
"pln_man_31_03","Check the vents, guys!"
"pln_man_34_01","Watch it guys, it's crumbling!"
"pln_man_34_03","Careful! The roof is about to collapse!"
"pln_man_35_03","Damn, it's stuck. Try shooting at the wires. "
"pln_man_36_01","No time to waste, shoot the wires and let it drop."
"pln_man_37_01","Guys it fell short. It's on the balcony. Let's go!"
"pln_man_40_02","The limo is on fire! Get him out!"
"pln_man_44_02","You could argue we are the good guys in this scenario, right? "
"pln_man_45_01","Ok last step, let's open her up."
"pln_man_46_02","We need a crowbar, look around."
"pln_man_47_01","Great it's open! Get Taxman outta there."
"pln_man_48_02","We need the server, don't forget it! "
"pln_man_49_01","The server's not on him."
"pln_man_54_01","Hit him!"
"pln_man_57_03","Okay, take it back a little, we don't want to kill him."
"pln_man_58_01","Watch the neck!"
"pln_man_59_03","You knocked him out? Really?"
"pln_man_60_01","Is he dead... guys?"
"pln_man_62_02","That won't do, everything is encrypted. We need more codes!"
"pln_man_62_03","Nope, that's not enough. Get him talking again!"
"pln_man_63b_01","That's the password, Starbreezer"
"pln_man_66_04","Get to the circuit breaker and get the power back on."
"pln_man_67_01","OK, start up the computer again and let's pick up where we got interrupted."
"pln_man_68_03","Nice job, contact resumed."
"pln_man_68_07","Great! We got contact again."
"pln_man_69_02","Alright, we're past the ASIM. They won't know what hit em."
"pln_man_70_01","OK guys, the authentication is almost complete. Keep an eye on that timer."
"pln_man_71_02","Guys, I got a callback from the accounting name, When that timer hits zero - we are clear for the transaction."
"pln_man_72_01","Done! We're through with loading up. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme..."
"pln_man_72_03","That's it! Time to cash in, baby!"
"pln_man_73_01","Fantastic! I confirmed the transaction of 25 million."
"pln_man_75_03","We're done, let's move and get out!"
"pln_man_77_01","Keep going guys!"
"pln_man_77_02","Let's go, let's go!"
"pln_man_77_03","Chop, chop, people!"
"pln_mcr_22_any_01","All those pretty automobiles..."
"pln_misc_sj_dgh_01_02","That's them! They were here just like Wick said. Tie them up and leave them by the van. Wick will take care of the scum when we get back. "
"pln_misc_sj_dgh_03_02","No! Dammit, gang... Wick wanted to take care of them himself. He really had it in for these bastards. I guess he will have to be content with the idea of them dead."
"pln_misc_sj_dgh_03_03","Dammit! Why did you do that? You were supposed to bring them to Wick, not kill them yourselves... I'm not sure how he'll react to this. This is the only thing he's been talking about since he saw that disgusting video..."
"pln_misc_sj_dgh_04_01","Good. Let the bastards squirm in fear while we take care of the bank. "
"pln_misc_sj_dgh_05_02","They're getting away from the van. Wick will be pissed if you don't bring them back to the safe house!"
"pln_moon_02_05","Give Santa a good thrashing! Wake him up!"
"pln_moon_05_01","Get that box!"
"pln_moon_05_02","Get the Jewelry box!"
"pln_moon_08_01","You have to steal Tin Boy!"
"pln_moon_09_02","Search in the piles and find Tin Boy!"
"pln_moon_10_02","Get that shoe box people!"
"pln_moon_11_02","Check the computer. Got to find the shoes!"
"pln_moon_11_03","Check the shoe store's stock in the computer."
"pln_moon_13_03","Come on, we have to get the shoes with the cocaine!"
"pln_moon_15_03","Look in the boxes, gang!"
"pln_moon_16_03","He hid the coke with a VR headset. Find it, it should be in the electronics store."
"pln_moon_17_01","Open the door to the back office!"
"pln_moon_17_02","Get that back office door open!"
"pln_moon_21_01","Make sure you find the right wine!"
"pln_moon_21_02","Find the right wine now!"
"pln_moon_22_02","Helicopter will be here in one minute."
"pln_moon_25_02","To get that tree out, you need to blow the glass roof off the mall. Just light a flare and then wait for Bile, he'll be bringing in some C4."
"pln_moon_27_02","Vlad wants the Christmas tree. Bile is on his way now!"
"pln_moon_28_01","Plant the C4 and blow the roof off."
"pln_moon_31_01","Attach the frame to the tree!"
"pln_moon_33_01","You need to get Santa up the tree so he can fly out with it!"
"pln_moon_36_01","Ok, it's time to go!"
"pln_moon_36_04","Time to escape!"
"pln_nai_01_02","Cook meth. Same as always."
"pln_nai_02_03","Momma always said it was a big world out there, but this..."
"pln_nai_05_02","Okay, I have ingredients on their way. Stand by."
"pln_nai_05_03","Stand by, crew. I got a batch of ingredients on their way."
"pln_nai_08_01","Okay. That's good. Now get more in there."
"pln_nai_12_01","Good spot. Now we wait."
"pln_nai_12_03","That's it. Now wait for the pilot to signal in."
"pln_nai_16_02","Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble. Mostly toil and trouble. Especially trouble."
"pln_nai_17_01","Not a single bag?! This is a nightmare!"
"pln_nai_17_03","You didn't get anything out? "
"pln_nai_18_02","The job wasn't a total bust. Still, fewer stuffed bags than under Leatherface's stairs!"
"pln_nai_18_03","It's a bare bones haul, but it'll do. Better luck next year, crew."
"pln_nai_20_01","Hot damn! You guys did great! Enjoy your payday - you deserve it."
"pln_nai_20_02","We came, we saw, we kicked their ass!"
"pln_nai_21_04","I want to hear a cry of fear from those cops!"
"pln_nai_22_03","It's cooking. What music it makes!"
"pln_nai_cnc_01_02","Halloween treat, guys. Headed back to the cabin in the woods."
"pln_nai_intro_01_01","Here to cook a little meth. Just like we did last summer."
"pln_nightclub_stage1_02_any_01","Vlad says the club profits are all in a safe somewhere in the office."
"pln_nightclub_stage1_05_any_02","Look for the office, guys - it's on the second floor."
"pln_nightclub_stage1_13_any_02","Escape is here in a minute!"
"pln_nightclub_stage1_bag_02_01","The ammo bag can be found in the storage room."
"pln_nightclub_stage1_brief_01","OK, we're going to pay a visit to the Tasteful club and uh, liberate their cash reserve. Nothing special. Find the manager's office, contain the crowd, make sure we leave in one piece. "
"pln_nightclub_stage1_end_a_02","Cops bloodied our nose on that one - somehow I think Vlad was holding back information... As usual. But you did well... Let's see what old Vlad tells us. "
"pln_nightclub_stage1_end_b_02","Not a cop in the world saw this one coming. Russians will be furious and Vlad will OD on vodka. Let's get paid."
"pln_nightclub_stage1_intro_a_02","I don't want you hanging around that club for too long. I don't trust this to be as easy as Vlad says. Hit the manager's safe and get the hell out. If you get any phone numbers, I don't want to know."
"pln_nightclub_stage1_intro_a_03","Vlad is probably right about the police being quick on the draw here. Get in and get out fast after you empty that manager's safe. And Wolf, stay off the dance floor. "
"pln_nmh_02_01","You'll have about seven seconds to take out the cameras before the alarm goes off."
"pln_nmh_03_01","You're looking for three cameras."
"pln_nmh_06_01","I count twelve cameras to deal with."
"pln_nmh_107_02","Bring the cooler!"
"pln_nmh_109_01","Get out of that burning steel coffin, gang!"
"pln_nmh_114_01","Sorry guys, Bile had to leave you for dead..."
"pln_nmh_115_02","Wow. That was a helluva thing. You all right? No missing limbs?"
"pln_nmh_16_01","Two."
"pln_nmh_18_01","Ok, that takes care of the cameras."
"pln_nmh_20_02","Now you just gotta make sure no one gets away and alerts the guards in the ICU."
"pln_nmh_22_02","Don't let any hostage run off and trigger the alarm!"
"pln_nmh_25_01","There goes the alarm. Guess we gotta do this the hard way."
"pln_nmh_26_01","Don't kill any hostages! We want to do this low-key."
"pln_nmh_26_02","No killing hostages, guys! You'll attract too much attention."
"pln_nmh_30_01","Don't let it keep ringing, someone's gonna get suspicious!"
"pln_nmh_33_01","Uhm... didn't we solve this already? "
"pln_nmh_40_01","There's a repair man coming to check the cameras."
"pln_nmh_43_01","You gotta find the patient file, guys."
"pln_nmh_44_01","Keep searching."
"pln_nmh_44_03","It might've been misplaced- check everywhere!"
"pln_nmh_44_05","You're taking forever guys..."
"pln_nmh_44_06","You need to look faster gang. Time is running out."
"pln_nmh_47_01","I know you don't like it guys, but it's a huge payday, and that extra bonus item I need to get my hands on. It's worth not asking too many questions."
"pln_nmh_52_02","OK, gotta find a way to make sure none of the hostages does anything stupid. Set up the fake sentry guns."
"pln_nmh_55_01","There's a locker room by the reception. Get there and get into some scrubs."
"pln_nmh_56_01","Come on gang, scrub up!"
"pln_nmh_58_02","Don't forget- stay in character."
"pln_nmh_59_02","Stop screwing around, guys! Now you gotta grind through metal doors for ages."
"pln_nmh_62_02","Do them one by one, and keep the cops away."
"pln_nmh_63_02","OK, it's done. Go have a look at the patient."
"pln_nmh_70_03","Get to a centrifuge and test that sample."
"pln_nmh_71_04","Still not enough, you need to take another sample."
"pln_nmh_74_01","You need two samples. Go get 'em."
"pln_nmh_74_03","You afraid of needles or something? Stick him!"
"pln_nmh_76_02","Hit the elevator button."
"pln_nmh_79_01","Maybe... two minutes. IF I don't get interrupted."
"pln_nmh_80_02","Guys, I'm getting a bad feeling here. Military-industrial com channels are going like crazy. Looks like we caught some nasty attention."
"pln_nmh_81_02","They cut the power, get it back up! Fast! The elevator won't move otherwise."
"pln_nmh_81_03","Crap, they're fast. Get the power back on!"
"pln_nmh_81_05","Bastards cut the power. You gotta get it back."
"pln_nmh_82_01","Elevator aint' going nowhere until you get the power back on."
"pln_nmh_83_02","Power is back, great. Now don't stop. "
"pln_nmh_87_02","Put two vials in the cooler so you can leave."
"pln_nmh_88_04","We can leave one you've got two samples in the cooler."
"pln_nmh_92_04","Hop in the elevator guys, then get your asses to the roof!"
"pln_nmh_94_01","That's strange... merc units are pulling out. "
"pln_nmh_95_01","What the hell... you're not gonna ... other air units in the area."
"pln_nmh_99_01","Guys!... Guys! You still there?! Get... -out!"
"pln_pal_01_01","We're here for the plates. They've been printing fortunes over the last months, spending wildly. Blood's in the water and we're the sharks!"
"pln_pal_04_04","Keep things cool. Don't give the nosey neighbours something to talk about."
"pln_pal_05_01","The cops have sent an patrol to investigate. They'll be here soon."
"pln_pal_06_04","Alright, there's the door and there's the first lock. Get the codebreakers working."
"pln_pal_07_02","OK, no time to lose. Start the codebreaker! "
"pln_pal_09_01","Dammit, the cops disabled the hacking device! You need to reboot it!"
"pln_pal_09_02","Don't let the cops reach the hacking device! Now you're gonna have to reboot it."
"pln_pal_12_01","Keep going guys - no one's seen you yet."
"pln_pal_14_01","Pick up the phone or they'll know something is off."
"pln_pal_15_03","They have called in another car. Take care of it. "
"pln_pal_16_03","All right, the cops are inside. Quiet takedowns! "
"pln_pal_17_01","Who fired? You guys are made now. Go to plan B!"
"pln_pal_18_01","That noise... Ahh some suspicious neighbours called the cops!"
"pln_pal_20_04","I can see one of the civilians making a run for it!"
"pln_pal_20_05","One of the civilians is making a run for it!"
"pln_pal_23_03","Damn! That's it for stealth - time for action. Get ready for company!"
"pln_pal_24_01","Wow, the police are calling for heavy reinforcement. They'll be here any moment!"
"pln_pal_25_01","Get into the shelter!"
"pln_pal_25_02","Into the shelter! Move it!"
"pln_pal_25_03","Gang, get to the shelter - hustle!"
"pln_pal_26_01","Ok guys, get the gates open. Find a crowbar or something."
"pln_pal_28_04","Through this door we should get to the money plates. "
"pln_pal_29_03","Man, these boys got themselves a Franz-Jaeger safe. Wasn't expecting that! Okay....well, with what we got there's only one way we're cracking that - water!"
"pln_pal_30_02","So, here's the plan. Get a hose down the hole from up top, and blow a pack of C4 inside the water filled safe. After that, grab the loot and get out of there."
"pln_pal_31_03","Alright, here's what you do. Get a drill onto the safe. Make a hole in it. Then, we need to fill it with water. Drag the garden hose down."
"pln_pal_32_01","Get a drill onto the safe, gang."
"pln_pal_33_01","Ok the drill is up and running!"
"pln_pal_37_01","Fill her up good, guys!"
"pln_pal_38_01","Get the water hose and connect it to the safe!"
"pln_pal_39_04","Time to put the water hose to use, turn it on!"
"pln_pal_39_06","Now let the water flow!"
"pln_pal_39_08","Now turn on the water!"
"pln_pal_42_06","Get the valve open again, crew!"
"pln_pal_42_08","Turn the water back on!"
"pln_pal_43_01","Police will burst into the house."
"pln_pal_44_03","These Florida cops don't mess around. They smashed right through Wilson's wall!"
"pln_pal_45_01","SWATs are coming in from the north, on Keel Street."
"pln_pal_47_01","SWATs coming in from the east!"
"pln_pal_49_01","The place is booby trapped!"
"pln_pal_49_02","It's a trap! Either you defuse these C4s or you get the hell outta there!"
"pln_pal_50_01","Quick! Grab the loot."
"pln_pal_51a_01","Oh, my god!"
"pln_pal_52_02","That was not a bomb shelter either, just concrete and plaster walls, C4 I must say was a bit.. overkill."
"pln_pal_54_03","Check out those money stacks, must be a good print. Worth a fortune on the streets."
"pln_pal_55_02","At least we got the cash before it blew!"
"pln_pal_55_03","Ha! At least you grabbed the money before the bang!"
"pln_pal_56_01","Our money's still burning. That's sad sad sad..."
"pln_pal_56_02","Can't let them all away..."
"pln_pal_56_03","We blew the money."
"pln_pal_57_01","Yes! Great work. Now stick the C4 into the hole in the safe"
"pln_pal_59_02","Now that's hydropool euphoria. Get the loot!"
"pln_pal_63_03","All that printing press needs is paper and ink. Cha-ching! Instant cash!"
"pln_pal_65_01","Dammit, the ink seems to have run out! Replace it!"
"pln_pal_69_02","Turn on the power again!"
"pln_pal_69_03","Get the power back on!"
"pln_pal_73_01","Grab the counterfeit and do another load or take what we have and scram."
"pln_pal_73_02","That's a sweet pile of counterfeit cash. Beautiful. Grab it. And if you fancy a little more..."
"pln_pal_74_01","Glad you asked how we get the counterfeit money out of there. I'm dispatching our pilot."
"pln_pal_77_01","Through the tunnels and get to the beach, gentlemen!"
"pln_pal_79_03","We're not going to be stopped by a gate now. Get it open!"
"pln_pal_81_03","Crash a pool party. Get paid. Not bad at all."
"pln_pdsg_01_05","Fuck yeah. "
"pln_polin_01_04","20 until police arrive."
"pln_polin_01_05","20 and counting - cops imminent."
"pln_polin_02_01","Police are closing in. They are here in 30 seconds."
"pln_polin_02_02","30 seconds until the police arrive."
"pln_polin_03_04","Police arriving at your location in 40 seconds."
"pln_polin_03_05","T minus 40 seconds. Cops soon to be there!"
"pln_polin_04_04","About 60 seconds until police arrives. They are scrambling!"
"pln_polin_04_05","Community radio says cops in 60 seconds. Bless them for the heads up!"
"pln_pow_01_05","Police are incoming - keep your guns up."
"pln_pow_01_06","Police en route - coming in fast!"
"pln_pp_bb1_a_03","Front entrance. Consider it a way in only."
"pln_pp_bb1_b_03","Access to the roof is here. Emergency ladder."
"pln_pp_bb1_k_01","Manager office can be accessed via roof. Good place for keycards. Computer could be important."
"pln_pp_bb1_m_01","This is where the zip-line to access the crane will be."
"pln_pp_bb1_n_01","Wide open area. Lot of sightlines. Use it, but be careful. Snipers enjoy good coverage here."
"pln_pp_bb1_n_03","Main lobby. A lot of space. Use it, but take care when it goes loud. Cops'll tag you from anywhere."
"pln_pp_hm2_03_01","We got wind of a mountain of coke on the top floor. They'll do everything to keep you off that stash. Get to it before the Commissar destroys it. You know what they say: "The early bird catches the grade-a product"."
"pln_pp_hm2_04_01","Commissar is known as a ruthless bastard. Kidnapping, torture and executions are well within his M.O. Likely to see a few hostages around the place."
"pln_pt1_02_01","Well, what does a goat sound like?"
"pln_pt1_02_02","What noise does a goat make?"
"pln_pt1_03_01","That should be all of them! Time to ride out. Get in the wheels and get out of there. "
"pln_pt1_04_03","Job's done here, guys. Time to roll! Into the car!"
"pln_pt1_05_01","You'll close this out quicker if you use the car to move the goats."
"pln_pt1_05_03","Gotta get them goats back quickly. Use the car!"
"pln_pt1_06_02","Don't forget the goat in that apartment block. "
"pln_pt1_11_02","A goat in a fan? This day gets weirder. Find the circuit box to halt the fan."
"pln_pt1_12_02","Circuit box is likely outside. Hacking it will stop the fan."
"pln_pt1_17_03","What was it doing up...?"
"pln_pt1_18_01","There's another one! Caught in the scaffolding! Watch out! Looks like it's electrocuted! Disable the power!"
"pln_pt1_18_03","Look, up in the scaffold! Another goat. But, hold up! It looks like that ladder is electrocuted. Disable power!"
"pln_pt1_21_02","Ladder's electrified. Disable it at the power box!"
"pln_pt1_27_01","Streetlight is down. Grab the goat!"
"pln_pt1_27_02","That's the streetlight done. Now grab that goat!"
"pln_pt1_28_03","Cops are rescuing the goats! Is this what tax money pays for!?"
"pln_pt2_05_01","There's gotta be boards around that barn. Use 'em to block the windows."
"pln_pt2_05_03","That barn must have something lying around you can nail across the windows."
"pln_pt2_08_03","Too much action here. I'll have the guys build the cage at the bridge."
"pln_pt2_09_01","Reckon the best place for the guys to build the cage is on the road."
"pln_pt2_09_03","Too much going on here. The road looks best for the guys to assemble the cage."
"pln_pt2_11_02","When you're ready, raise the balloon and the pilot will swing by and collect."
"pln_pt2_12_01","There's the balloon. Hey, you see it, guy?"
"pln_pt2_15_01","Excellent! Now get outta there! Grab your car from the truck!"
"pln_pt2_15_02","Fantastic! Time to leave. Grab the car, crew!"
"pln_pt2_19_02","Okay, listen. Twitch is waiting for you up ahead, just on the other side of the bridge. He's got a truck. Just drive straight up on into it, and this caper is closed."
"pln_pt2_20_02","Damn, the cops turned the bridge! Get into the control room there, and turn it back. You need to be on the other side!"
"pln_pt2_21_02","All right, bridge is turning back. Gonna take a few minutes though. Hold off the cops, gang!"
"pln_pt2_23_02","The control room manages the bridge. Use the buttons in there!"
"pln_pt2_24_02","All right! Bridge is back! Now, into the car and get the hell out of there!"
"pln_rats_stage1_01_any_01","Get into the house and see if you can find Hector's cooks."
"pln_rats_stage1_02_any_01","Get into the house."
"pln_rats_stage1_06_any_01","Looks like Hector's cooks are dead. We have to make the meth ourselves!"
"pln_rats_stage1_10_any_01","Here they come guys. Choppers and SWAT vans all over the place around you. Stay on your toes!"
"pln_rats_stage1_11_any_02","Incoming! From the lumber mill! Stay on your toes!"
"pln_rats_stage1_12_any_02","The railway bridge! They are coming in from the railway bridge, keep them away."
"pln_rats_stage1_14_any_01","Be careful! They have snipers incoming!"
"pln_rats_stage1_16_any_01","We are going to need ingredients, so scout the place and see what you can find."
"pln_rats_stage1_22_any_01","Add caustic soda to continue the process!"
"pln_rats_stage1_27_any_01","We can't use the lab anymore, it's gone. Take what you have and let's leave."
"pln_rats_stage1_31_any_01","Awesome! With all those bags, the trade should be smooth."
"pln_rats_stage2_07_any_01","Looks like we'll be doing this the hard way. Stay low and search those apartments for the info! Look for safes!"
"pln_rats_stage2_13_any_01","Feds or no feds, we need that intel! You'll have to search the apartments! Look for safes!"
"pln_rats_stage3_05_any_01","The money is yours to take. If you have the codes you will be able to defuse the planted C4s."
"pln_rats_stage3_10_any_01","Good job, the rat is dead, escape helicopter is waiting, unless you want to try to go for the money in that bus, get to the chopper and we'll get you the hell out of there."
"pln_rat_stage1_03_any_01","Remember we will need at least four bags of meth."
"pln_rat_stage1_06_any_01","Looks like Hector's cooks are dead. We have to make the meth ourselves!"
"pln_rat_stage1_09_any_01","Make shure no SWATs get in to the lab. Keep them away at all costs!"
"pln_rat_stage1_10_any_01","Here they come guys. Choppers and SWAT vans all over the place around you. Stay on your toes!"
"pln_rat_stage1_11_any_03","They are coming in from the lumber mill, watch out!"
"pln_rat_stage1_12_any_01","They are coming from the railway bridge! Watch out!"
"pln_rat_stage1_12_any_03","SWATs incoming from the lumber mill, keep them away!"
"pln_rat_stage1_17_any_01","You need to add an ingredient, make sure you don't use the wrong thing. One wrong step and the lab will torch up like a christmas tree."
"pln_rat_stage1_21_any_01","You need to add the caustic soda to keep the process going!"
"pln_rat_stage1_24_any_01","Add hydrogen chloride, to continue the process!"
"pln_rat_stage1_26_any_02","Ah, what!? Guys, you have to be careful with that stuff, I told you!"
"pln_rat_stage1_30_any_01","Good job. Four bags is good enough to go and do the trade."
"pln_rat_stage1_34_any_01","Good thinking! Use those boards to barricade more windows."
"pln_rat_stage1_end_a_03","If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen eh? Well done. We got enough meth to deal with Hector. Let's get back in town. "
"pln_rat_stage1_end_c_02","We're short on product so for now I think we're best keeping Hector in the dark. Maybe we can solve the issue another way. "
"pln_rat_stage1_end_c_03","We came up a little short. Let's just play along and try to solve the Rat problem for Hector another way. We're inventive..."
"pln_rat_stage1_intro_a_02b","Oh yeah, get the meth out before the FBI arrives - they've been tipped off, as if you weren't feeling lucky already."
"pln_rat_stage2_end_d_01","That was like Baghdad all over again. You need to roll. Hector's got a line on the Mendozas on their way to the airport. We're gonna hit their convoy like a ten ton hammer."
"pln_rat_stage3_02_any_01","Remember, we are after the rat, Head for the bus, keep your heads low and move from cover to cover."
"pln_rat_stage3_07_any_01","Be careful around that C4 guys."
"pln_rat_stage3_09_any_01","Chopper is there, throw the bags into the chopper."
"pln_rat_stage3_end_c_01","Great job, people. The Mendozas are out of business and their liquidity is riding shotgun in our chopper. Sweet."
"pln_rat_stage3_intro_a_01","Crew, this is us ending Mendoza ops in DC right here and right now. Hit that bus hard and take their money. Hector just wants these clowns ended so the money is ours. Set down in 3, 2, 1, go!"
"pln_rat_stage3_intro_a_03","OK, the Mendoza bus is on the bridge, which means we land to take it out in ten minutes. Hit the bus, finish off their people, take the money. Simple."
"pln_rt1b_04_02","There're the ingredients. Grab 'em! Secure them in the house."
"pln_rt1b_05_02","Alright. Don't burn the place down, guys."
"pln_rt1b_05_03","Great. Let's cook a little more product. Just don't set anything on fire."
"pln_rt1b_cbf_01_01","You guys remember that sketchy old house out in the forest? Where Hector's guys were cooking up meth? Well, we're headed back there. "
"pln_rt1_04_any_02","We need chemicals to cook. Muriatic acid, caustic soda and hydrogen chloride. Easy."
"pln_rt1_07_any_02","Guys, three bags should be enough to do the trade."
"pln_rt1_08_any_01","Goddammit! Someone got here first... Careful..."
"pln_rt1_10_any_02","Hectors cooks are dead. We need to do the cooking ourselves... OK..."
"pln_rt1_12_any_02","OK - looks stable, for now. Add more stuff..."
"pln_rt1_12_any_08","OK, solid."
"pln_rt1_15_any_03","SWAT, SWAT on the balcony!"
"pln_rt1_20_any_02","Ah, OK... Muria, muriatic acid. Add more."
"pln_rt1_20_any_08","Hm, yeah it is not caustic soda... Yeah. It should be acid. Yep, sure that is it."
"pln_rt1_22_any_02","Says we need club soda to get this temperature up... Sounds odd. What can you get?"
"pln_rt1_24_any_05","It needs hydrogen chloride - for sure."
"pln_rt1_25_02","I should really read up on this stuff, shouldn't I?"
"pln_rt1_25_03","I guess that wasn't it."
"pln_rt1_25_07","That's what you get for trusting the internet, I guess."
"pln_rt1_25_08","Woah. What are the odds? Yeah maybe they weren't that good..."
"pln_rt1_25_13","Did you hear that loud bang? Guys?"
"pln_rt1_25_14","Death by meth..."
"pln_rt1_a_01","Alright, let's see..."
"pln_rt1_a_08","Uh... mhm..."
"pln_rt1_c2_04","...caustic soda?"
"pln_rt1_d1_01","Hydrogen chloride."
"pln_rt1_e_04","That should get things cooking."
"pln_rt1_e_09","Add some."
"pln_rt1_f_03","No, wait!"
"pln_rt1_f_09","Hold it! You didn't put it in yet, right?"
"pln_rt1_g_05","Yeah it's acid, muriatic acid."
"pln_rt1_h_06","My bad. It's caustic soda."
"pln_rt1_j_01","...I think."
"pln_rt1_j_03","...IF my calculations are correct."
"pln_rt1_j_09","...that's my very best guess."
"pln_rt1_j_18","...and kiss your lucky charms."
"pln_rt3_07_any_02","Watch that C4 - they rigged the whole bus."
"pln_rt3_15_any_02","Awesome you got them all - I think."
"pln_rt3_16_any_02","Speed up!"
"pln_rt3_17_any_02","It's going to blow! Run!"
"pln_rt3_19_any_01","That's a clean sweep. All the Mendozas are history. Get to the chopper or go for the money they got on that bus."
"pln_run_03_02","I hear cops' sirens everywhere. You're gonna get a lot of heat, guys!"
"pln_run_06_01","You gotta fight your way past the cops and meet up with Eddie. Move!"
"pln_run_07_02","This whole scenario is just too familiar."
"pln_run_08_03","Don't let him get away!"
"pln_run_08_05","Take that bastard out!"
"pln_run_09_02","Come on, move, they're locking you down!"
"pln_run_11_01","The crash site is just after the underpass - Hurry!"
"pln_run_11_03","There it is! Right after the underpass!"
"pln_run_12_01","Whoah, that is some crash!"
"pln_run_12_02","He really crashed it good!"
"pln_run_13_02","See if you can get him out of the van."
"pln_run_13_03","Try to get him out of the van."
"pln_run_15_02","Bring some gas cans!"
"pln_run_15_03","Find some fuel!"
"pln_run_20_02","Get to the top of the overpass so Bile can pick you up."
"pln_run_21_03","Go on forward guys!"
"pln_run_22_03","Get to the overpass and then keep going up the hill."
"pln_run_23_03","Clear the pickup zone so Bile can get in there!"
"pln_run_25_01","Get rid of the cops!"
"pln_run_26_01","You need to shoot the gas can to set it on fire!"
"pln_run_26_03","Shoot the gas can to set it on fire!"
"pln_run_intro_01","What... it's Matt Roscoe! Of course that weasel had to be involved! Maybe you should just kill him here and now!"
"pln_run_intro_03","What... it's Matt Roscoe! Of course that weasel had to be involved! Maybe you should just kill him here and now!"
"pln_run_intro_04","It's Matt Roscoe! Don't let him get away! Maybe you should just kill him!"
"pln_rvd_02_03","Suck in those guts, guys. Let's make a good impression. Go meet the gang."
"pln_rvd_03_02","C'mon, guys. Let's be professional, not late."
"pln_rvd_03_03","We only have a short window of opportunity, guys."
"pln_rvd_03_05","Try not to be late guys, don't want to look unprofessional."
"pln_rvd_03_06","Guys, you need to get moving."
"pln_rvd_03_08","What's the delay, see a movie star or somethin'?"
"pln_rvd_04_02","I guess I should be surprised to see GenSec out there, but those guys seem to be spreading."
"pln_rvd_08_02","OK, I got you a new plan but you need to be quick. Mr Blonde, did you bring the freezer juice?"
"pln_rvd_09_01","Great. OK guys, first you need to access the vault. Blueprint says it's in the back office."
"pln_rvd_11_01","There's a router box somewhere in the lunchroom. Hook me into it and I'll open the door.."
"pln_rvd_12_01","Hack me into the lobby computer and I'll unlock the door."
"pln_rvd_12_02","If you plug me into the lobby computer, I can hack the door."
"pln_rvd_13_01","Still waiting on that network hook up guys."
"pln_rvd_13_05","Hook me up guys, c'mon."
"pln_rvd_15_03","Strange blockers on the network. Almost done though."
"pln_rvd_16_02","Got it. You can open the door."
"pln_rvd_18_06","Stop screwing around and get to the vault."
"pln_rvd_20_01","First thing to do is mount a couple drills on that door."
"pln_rvd_20_03","First, we need holes. Get two drills on that door."
"pln_rvd_21_02","Can't do anything until those drills are working."
"pln_rvd_24_02","Hey, on the upper floor there's a high-voltage box. Sabotage it and you should be fine to handle the vault."
"pln_rvd_24_03","Blueprints show a power box on the upper floor. Get to it and cut the power."
"pln_rvd_30_02","Some loose stones over there if you wanna grab them on the way."
"pln_rvd_30_03","Someone isn't too worried about thieves..."
"pln_rvd_31_01","What's a GenSec truck doing way out there?"
"pln_rvd_32_03","Okay, first drill is through."
"pln_rvd_33_03","Okay, both holes are drilled."
"pln_rvd_36_01","Then I guess my guys will have to do the real work. Get the tanks from the car, guys."
"pln_rvd_39_02","I did the research, this is gonna work great."
"pln_rvd_40_02","You need to mount both tanks."
"pln_rvd_40_03","Got those tanks mounted yet?"
"pln_rvd_40_04","Hurry up guys, mount those tanks."
"pln_rvd_40_05","Tanks on the door ASAP."
"pln_rvd_42_03","Nitrogen must almost be gone by now. Stand by, Bile is on the way with a little present."
"pln_rvd_44_02","Bile's package of C4 just came through the roof. Go up and get it, then stick it on the vault."
"pln_rvd_45_04","Let's crack that frozen vault!"
"pln_rvd_48_03","Let's give Mr Blonde a diversion. Make a break for it over by the Jack Rabbit Slim's so the cops will follow you and not Mr. Blonde and the loot."
"pln_rvd_50_02","You need to distract the cops. Shoot up the store, then get out of there."
"pln_rvd_53_01","Twitch is waiting for you on the other side of that door! Hurry!"
"pln_rvd_54_01","Get out of there guys."
"pln_rvd_54_02","Twitch is waiting and getting antsy!"
"pln_rvd_54_03","Hurry up guys, my grid is lighting up like crazy."
"pln_rvd_55_02","Ok gang, no time for backslapping. Get out of there AS --- something ---."
"pln_sfr_01d_02","Nice work! The first wave was beaten back!"
"pln_sfr_01w_02","Get ready for the first wave!"
"pln_sfr_01_01","Defend against the cops! Don't let them grab any money bags!"
"pln_sfr_02w_02","Get ready for the second wave!"
"pln_sfr_03d_01","You've defeated the third wave of cops!"
"pln_sfr_03w_02","Get ready for the third wave!"
"pln_sfr_05d_02","Nice work! The fifth wave was beaten back!"
"pln_sfr_06d_01","You've defeated the sixth wave of cops!"
"pln_sfr_07d_02","Nice work! The seventh wave was beaten back!"
"pln_sfr_07w_02","Get ready for the seventh wave!"
"pln_sfr_08w_02","Get ready for the eighth wave!"
"pln_sfr_10d_02","Nice work! The tenth wave was beaten back!"
"pln_sfr_brf_01","I don't know who tipped the cops off, but I have good information confirming that they don't know who's on the premises. They'll be expecting a routine raid on a possible drugs operation. Give them a warm welcome, teach them to get their intel right."
"pln_sfr_cnc_02","Someone's tipped the cops off about suspicious activity at the Safe House!"
"pln_sfr_dfb_03","Don't let them take the bags!"
"pln_sfr_end_01","Ok gang. My mole in the police will take care of this. He'll send his guys to clean up and then report that the area was searched and they found nothing. No one will know you're here, you can relax."
"pln_sfr_gwa_01","Here they come! Prepare to beat them back!"
"pln_sfr_gwa_02","Here comes another wave of cops!"
"pln_sfr_gwd_01","Great job! You beat them back!"
"pln_sfr_gwd_02","Great defense, gang! None shall pass!"
"pln_sfr_gwd_03","Looks like you beat that wave! Keep it up!"
"pln_sfr_kb3_01","You've got to keep at least 3 bags!"
"pln_sfr_kb8_01","You've got to keep at least 8 bags!"
"pln_sfr_lst_01","Ok, that's the last of them. Now we need to make sure no one knows what happened here. I'm gonna make a call, hang on, guys..."
"pln_sh11_02_02","Keep moving and don't play around. You trigger the alarm, we're screwed."
"pln_sh11_02_03","Keep moving and get inside. This might be a game to you, but there are guards all around."
"pln_sh11_03_03","Yeah, I agree. You'll have to take him out."
"pln_sh11_05_02","Great. Bag that body and get it out of sight before someone sees it."
"pln_sh11_07_02","Okay, good. Now, keep going."
"pln_sh11_08_02","Another guard up ahead. Stay in the shadows."
"pln_sh11_10_03","Remember to hide that body."
"pln_sh11_15_01","Well, that's quite a mess all right. Now get these bodies out of sight."
"pln_sh11_17_01","Okay, with that mess taken care of, it's time to find the server room."
"pln_sh11_19_01","The Control-Guy seems to be a real dumbwit but we can't fool him forever. I'm betting he's sounding the alarm next time."
"pln_sh11_19_02","That Control-Guy doesn't seem to be the brightest tool in the shed, but next time even he will understand something's wrong."
"pln_sh11_19_03","We're lucky that Control-Guy is stupid as hell, but he's getting suspicious. Next time he'll most likely sound the alarm."
"pln_sh11_20_03","Throw him down there where no one should find him."
"pln_sh11_23_01","Yeah, yeah, we got what we came for."
"pln_sh11_27_01","Careful. Wait for him to move."
"pln_sh11_cbf_01_02","I need you to get inside an old Police storage compound and retrieve some access codes we will need later."
"pln_sh12_01_02","Time to show me some more of your stealthy skills. The rest of you wait by the van and keep a lookout if things would turn south."
"pln_sh12_02_03","The main entrance would be suicide. We're sneaking in from the side instead. Put on your mask and cut open that fence."
"pln_sh12_04_02","Be serious, Dallas. Now, get inside and get that door open"
"pln_sh12_06_01","What are you doing? As long as that camera is operational, you're not getting in unnoticed."
"pln_sh12_07_02","Great. Now, get to lock picking that door."
"pln_sh12_08_01","Damn it, Dallas! I told you to use the ECM Jammer. Destroying it will draw unnecessary attention."
"pln_sh12_09_02","GenSec have upped their game, that's for sure."
"pln_sh12_12_03","Get back inside and find the PC."
"pln_sh12_14_02","Okay, answer the pager then hide the body in that janitor closet you passed by."
"pln_sh12_15_03","Go and see if you can find one somewhere."
"pln_sh12_16_03","Keep your head down and avoid the cameras."
"pln_sh12_18_02","Hurry up and answer the pager."
"pln_sh12_20_01","Excellent! Go there and get hacking."
"pln_sh12_20_02","Perfect! Get there and let's work our magic."
"pln_sh12_21_01","Just try and sneak past him. Don't rush it."
"pln_sh12_25_02","You did good, Dallas. Now, get to the van and get out of there. "
"pln_sh12_27_02","I stashed some more body bags if you need some. Always plan ahead, Dallas. Always plan ahead."
"pln_sh12_28_01","Hey! Don't do that! That's like asking them to send more guards to investigate."
"pln_sh12_30_02","You got in and out without making a sound. Good job, Dallas. I mean it."
"pln_sh21_01_01","Remember, don't put on the mask. Case the place first."
"pln_sh21_01_03","Leave the mask off for now and start by "casing" the place. Walk around a bit and see what we're up against."
"pln_sh21_02_03","These civilians don't get paid enough to care about your business. Don't scare them."
"pln_sh21_03_03","You'll find the coke in the manager's office but it will be guarded, so stay on your toes."
"pln_sh21_07_01","Take a look around the office while you wait for the drill. Might be some other loot we can take."
"pln_sh21_09_01","Holy...! They setup a sniper in the building across the street! Keep your head down and take him out!"
"pln_sh21_11_02","That sure showed them not to mess with you. Now, grab the coke and return to the van. Time to get out of here."
"pln_sh21_12_01","That's it, you made it! Throw the coke in the van and let's go."
"pln_sh21_12_02","You did it! Now, throw the cocaine in the back and let's head out."
"pln_sh21_12_03","Good job! Throw the coke in the van and get out of there!"
"pln_sh21_intro_01_02","We're at the night club. Time to get your dance-on. Start by "casing" the place before the fun begins. Take a look around first and keep things casual."
"pln_sh22_01_02","I'm getting a helicopter to pick you up, but it's gonna take some time."
"pln_sh22_02_02","Heads up, the SWAT-team is here! "
"pln_sh22_03_02","Your teammate is down! Help him!"
"pln_sh22_04_03","Dallas! Get the cocaine from the van before the cops!"
"pln_sh22_07_01","Just sit back and let me negotiate a deal with the cops."
"pln_sh22_08_01","OK, it's done. Release the hostage now to trade back our friend."
"pln_sh22_09_01","Put down the cocaine and deploy a doctor bag and heal up."
"pln_sh22_09_02","OK, take this time to heal up. Drop the cocaine and put down a doctor bag."
"pln_sh22_09_03","Use this time to heal yourselves up. Drop the cocaine and put down a doctor bag."
"pln_sh22_11_01","Okay, get out of there. You don't have time to pick the lock, so just shoot the door handle."
"pln_sh22_12_03","Wait, don't shoot! Make him give up instead by intimidating him. He can be useful to us."
"pln_sh22_13_02","Get to the roof now, and wait for the helicopter!"
"pln_sh22_16_01","Bastards called in a SHIELD! Try and flank him!"
"pln_sh22_17_03","Your ride's here! Throw in the cocaine in the helicopter!"
"pln_sh_int_05_01","There we go, now put your mask on."
"pln_sh_int_06_01","OK, I trust you hear me loud and clear. Alright, we don't have any time to waste, let's just get to it."
"pln_sh_int_09_01","Look up."
"pln_sh_int_11_01","Nice catch! You are ready for this!"
"pln_sh_int_17_01","Cool - 25 large. Spend them well."
"pln_sh_int_21_01","Now, pick up the money."
"pln_sh_int_25_01","See that statue - Lady Justice. Hand her some money."
"pln_sh_int_26_01","Get down there, I'll show you a secret."
"pln_sh_int_29_01","Yeah, straight ahead there is your own private vault. We're gonna stack that up."
"pln_sh_int_33_01","New contact on Crime.net, guys. Got a shady politician with ambition. We call him The Elephant for now. Look him up."
"pln_sh_int_35_01","Here I put some bags. You can try out the different weights. Gold is heavy, as you know. Good to get a feel for them and how far you can throw."
"pln_sh_int_37_01","I love this room. Give your weapons a try in here. "
"pln_sh_int_51_01","I set up a little test case for you to see how these work."
"pln_sh_int_55_01","But hell, if you're good - that's the edge you need."
"pln_sh_int_59_01","If you get enough... Maybe we can upgrade this place, huh?"
"pln_sh_int_62_01","Otherwise, any questions? I'm sure you can figure out the rest. Feel free to come here whenever you want."
"pln_sh_int_63_01","It might be worth coming by consistently. "
"pln_sh_int_68_01","Here you can hang all your modified weapons. It will be quite a rack."
"pln_sh_int_70_01","I love this place. Cops don't swing by too often."
"pln_sh_int_73_01","Hit the Crime.net station to get out of here."
"pln_sh_int_73_03","The Crime.net station is your ticket to action. Go when you are ready."
"pln_sh_int_76_01","Let's do this."
"pln_sh_int_77_01","If you want the information again, just play the pre-recorded message using the button."
"pln_sh_int_77_02","I've recorded all of the information, access it by pressing that button."
"pln_sh_int_79_01","Get out to the alley."
"pln_spa_03_01","Find the sniper and take him out before he takes the shot!"
"pln_spa_03_02","Find that sniper and take him out!"
"pln_spa_04_02","Take that sniper out!"
"pln_spa_04_03","Get the sniper guys!"
"pln_spa_05_03","The guys in the street - take 'em out!"
"pln_spa_05_04","You gotta clear the street!"
"pln_spa_06_03","Snipers! You gotta take 'em out!"
"pln_spa_07_02","They're deploying another group of snipers!"
"pln_spa_09_02","Good work, gang - but the NYPD won't give up so easily."
"pln_spa_09_03","A rough day for the NYPD. And it'll get rougher - I'm sure they'll send more reinforcements."
"pln_spa_10_03","More cops incoming, guys!"
"pln_spa_12_02","Guys, move! Charon will meet you in the other building."
"pln_spa_14_02","That gate looks tough. See if you can find some thermite or something. You have to get that briefcase."
"pln_spa_16_03","You'll need to drill that gate to get the briefcase!"
"pln_spa_19_01","Hold on guys, I'm looking for a way out. If you cross the street you should be able to get out of here."
"pln_spa_19_02","Let's see... if you cross the street you should be able to get out of here."
"pln_spa_20_03","The van should be there in a minute. "
"pln_spa_21_02","What's wrong, Charon? You ok?"
"pln_spa_23_02","Move up to the windows, see what's going on!"
"pln_spa_23_03","Move up to those windows so you get a good view of things!"
"pln_spa_25_03","Remember Charon, guys! Don't leave him behind!"
"pln_spa_28_03","The briefcase! Don't leave it behind!"
"pln_spa_cnc_03","Gotta hurry, guys. The Continental just called, you're going to New York on a rescue mission."
"pln_tr1b_06_02","One of their security buffers just kicked in. Disconnect it!"
"pln_tr1_01_03","An access card. Great! That will help you get silent access to a railcar."
"pln_tr1_02_01","We can sell those shells, if you can carry them out. But focus on the turret."
"pln_tr1_03_01","That's it! That's what we're looking for. I'm sending the drill now."
"pln_tr1_04_02","That's the stuff. Keep going!"
"pln_tr1_08_01","That's live high explosive, so be gentle."
"pln_tr1_08_02","Handle that stuff with great care."
"pln_tr1_09_01","That's the alarm, guys. Expect a fast response!"
"pln_tr1_10_01","No need for tip-toeing now. I'm sending the chopper with the drill."
"pln_tr1_11_02","That's the turret recovered. Give me a moment. Your pick-up is on its way."
"pln_tr1_15_01","OK, the chopper is almost there. Stand by."
"pln_tr1_19_01","Guys, get into those cars and find the one with the turret."
"pln_tr1_22_02","Move the pieces of the cannon to the pick-up, gang."
"pln_tr1_24_01","Pilot is on the scene with the lance. Go get it."
"pln_tr1_24_02","That's the pilot with the lance. Get it."
"pln_tr1_28_03","They're blowing the doors off the railcars. You're going to be exposed to sniper fire in there, so be careful."
"pln_tr1_29_03","One high-tech, high-value piece of military badass right there."
"pln_tr1_30_01","We can get the ammo out, but only when the turret pieces are safely gathered in. Hide that ammo for now."
"pln_tr1_end_01_02","That's how the pros do it! Chalk it up. Payday Gang one, Armadillo corp zero."
"pln_ukranian_stage1_17_any_01","Alright, get in there and find the tiara."
"pln_ukranian_stage1_18_any_01","It has to be in there somewhere. Check the safes in the back first."
"pln_ukranian_stage1_24_any_01","Keep looking for that tiara!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_25_any_01","Here they come!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_25_any_02","Stay frosty! Here they come!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_29_any_02","Escape is here, so whenever you're ready!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_32_any_01","Everything except the tiara is for us!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_32_any_04","There's a lot of money in the shops, there."
"pln_ukranian_stage1_33_any_01","Has anyone found the tiara yet?"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_34_any_01","Check the stands in the shelves."
"pln_ukranian_stage1_35_any_01","Did you check the whole place? Check the whole place!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_36_any_01","Keep the civilians in check!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_36_any_03","Control the civilians!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_36_any_05","Keep it clean! Keep the civs out of the line of fire!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_37_any_02","You're still good. No one has heard you yet!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_39_any_01","Someone heard the drill!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_39_any_03","The alarm's been tripped!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_42_any_01","That girl made you, here we go."
"pln_ukranian_stage1_43_any_02","Metal detector! What the hell!?"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_44_any_01","Aw, so it's empty!? Keep looking!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_44_any_02","Alright, keep going! It's got to be there!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_45_any_01","Alright, we got spotted by the cameras. We got to go to plan B."
"pln_ukranian_stage1_45_any_02","Cameras got us, time for plan B."
"pln_ukranian_stage1_48_any_03","Dead civilians bring the heat, guys!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_49_any_01","Police snipers, damn it! Now we're really in for it!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_52_any_02","All the extra loot goes into all the pockets. The more, the better!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_53_any_03","Cold and calculated, just like we want it!"
"pln_ukranian_stage1_end_b_03","What do they call that? Bling? Anyway, time for a payday."
"pln_ukranian_stage1_end_c_01","Now that's a knockover. Good job getting everything there, that was a lot of work. The tiara is a bonus in this case and Vlad is happy as hell. "
"pln_vih_01_04","Escape is here, get ready!"
"pln_vih_02_01","Bring the bags to the van."
"pln_vih_02_06","Get the bags in the van guys."
"pln_vit_cbf_01","Ok, guys. This is it. The Greatest Heist of All. What you've been training for. The fucking White House! Inside is the answer to all our problems, an important part of which is a set of documents- Presidential pardons, still legal and valid, but without any names on them! If you can get them, you'll be able to get off scott free and retire. I don't have much longer- fucking Murky virus is eating more of my body every second, but damn it I'm gonna see this through to the end. Locke will be running this one for me, but don't worry... I'll be around. And don't make too big a mess of the Oval Office, got it?"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_03_any_01","Hold them back, I'm looking for an escape driver as we speak!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_06_any_01","Two minutes, two minutes till the pick-up car is here! Hold them back!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_06_any_02","Hey The pick-up car is coming here in two minutes so you just have to fight a little more!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_06_any_03","Hey, two minutes, we have two more minutes until the pick-up car! Not much longer!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_08_any_01","30 secs, get ready to move that coke!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_09_any_07","He'll be here soon!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_10_any_03","Alright, the pick-up driver is here! He's on the street behind you!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_12_any_01","OK! Now get the bags into the truck. We need at least four bags."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_12_any_03","People, get those bags into the truck. We need at least four bags."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_15_any_01","Beautiful! We just need two more - at least two more bags."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_17_any_04","Great, now we're making money here."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_18_any_01","Folks, the escape driver's coming in hot - he's gonna need some protection."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_19_any_02","Good job keeping it together in a tight spot! Now hustle to the docks!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_20_any_02","Shit! They got the driver! They got the driver! I need another option - hold on!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_21_any_02","OK people, I've got an alternate escape chopper coming. He'll be here soon!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_23_any_03","Chopper pilot's here! Move! Move! Move!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_brief_01","We're watchdogs on this job. Wear a heavy jacket and carry heavier weapons. We know Hectors transports are getting hit. You'll ride in the back of the truck. Don't let the coke go anywhere."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_end_b_02","That's enough coke, not all, but enough! Hectors people are at the harbor. You need to meet them and get the stuff onto their boat. Then call it a day - OK, a payday!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_01_any_04","A boat's coming in to get Hector's bags. We need to get 'em secured first."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_02_any_01","OK, no time to waste. The cops are right behind you, get the bags secured."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_05_any_01","The boat is coming in at dock 7, by the crane."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_06_any_03","Boat's moving, he'll be at dock 8 by the warehouse."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_07_any_01","He's coming in at dock 9, get ready!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_07_any_02","He'll be coming in at dock 9."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_07_any_03","The boat will be at dock 9 soon, get ready!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_08_any_02","The chopper will be there any minute."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_09_any_01","Your escape helicopter is here, I suggest you get the hell out of there!"
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_09_any_02","The escape chopper's in location. Now would be a good time to vacate the premises."
"pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_13_any_01","You probably want to hunker down by the warehouse."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_02_any_04","It looks like every cop in the district is in the parking lot."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_12_any_01","Keep it together."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_13_any_01","OK, Hector sent a pick-up driver, he'll be here soon."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_15_any_01","OK, they are coming down the back street."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_17_any_01","Throw the coke into the pick up truck!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_18_any_02","Get the coke in there."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_21_any_01","Cool, that's half of it!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_24_any_01","The escape driver is here. He snuck in behind the fence to the north."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_28_any_01","Hold up - dig in!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_39_any_01","Police chopper incoming!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_40_any_01","Ah, that's a SWAT chopper - expect snipers!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_41_any_01","Uh... This is bad..."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_41_any_03","Someone ratted on us, must be..."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_43_any_01","Get up across that walkway - he is on the other side."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_55_any_01","You heard him! Get to the chopper!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_62_any_01","That's four bags! It's what we need - but if you feel you can handle some more, go ahead!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_64_any_01","The're repossessing the bags!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_65_any_02","Don't forget - we need four bags!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_68_any_01","I've sent for an escape driver, stay on your toes - he will take a couple of minutes."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_69_any_01","Escape car is just a minute away, be ready!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_70_any_01","Escape driver is almost there, 30 seconds!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_74_any_01","You took too long, they got to your escape driver."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_74_any_02","Alright, we gotta go to plan B."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_76_any_01","Gimme a minute."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_76_any_02","I'm going to get a line on a chopper."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_80_any_01","They're pushing into the warehouse, look alert."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_84_any_01","Alright boys our escape car is here but the cops are on top of him."
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_86_any_01","Protect the car!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_intro_a_02","Dammit they're pulling your truck over! FBI... Don't let em take what's Hector's!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage1_intro_a_03","Ah, it's an FBI operation - no way out - they're gonna take you down unless you shoot your way outta there!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage2_14_any_01","The place was under surveillance! We are going for the bridge!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage2_17_any_01","Get the bags onto the boat."
"pln_watchdogs_stage2_21_any_01","Flip the switch a couple of times, that should be enough to get his attention."
"pln_watchdogs_stage2_22_any_01","Flip the switch, we need to signal the boat!"
"pln_watchdogs_stage2_intro_a_01","Get out, get to the bags before the FBI catches up to us again. I know, they're persistent little bastards, aren't they."
"pln_wwh_02_02","Damn it, we've been double-crossed. You've got incoming, get ready to fight."
"pln_wwh_04_02","The ship by the docks belongs to the Butcher! Locke sold her out too. Give them a hand and maybe they'll give you a ride."
"pln_wwh_06_01","Hey, someone needs help. Get over there."
"pln_wwh_06_02","Get over there and help the crew."
"pln_wwh_07_02","Great guys, you're going to need that saw."
"pln_wwh_08_02","Use the saw on that door, get the Captain out!"
"pln_wwh_08_03","You need to help the Captain, cut the door open!"
"pln_wwh_09_01","That saw doesn't seem too realiable, keep an eye on it."
"pln_wwh_09_03","Keep an eye on that saw until it's done."
"pln_wwh_12_01","I heard the blade cut through. Get that door open!"
"pln_wwh_13_03","Do whatever the Captain asks guys. I can't get you out any other way right now, so he's your only ticket back to warm weather."
"pln_wwh_end_01","Now there's a plan that went straight to hell. Don't worry about Locke, I'll find out where he went."
"plt_a01a_any_11","Aw, this is totally messed up guys!"
"plt_a01a_any_12","Yeah, this completely went south, guys!"
"plt_a01b_any_03","SWAT chopper tailed us from the scene."
"plt_a01b_any_04","SWAT chopper's right on top of us!"
"plt_a01b_any_13","We've got cops all over us!"
"plt_a01b_any_14","They tailed me and they're flying close!"
"plt_a01c_any_03","I can't lose 'em!"
"plt_a01d_any_03","Now would be a good time to find God!"
"plt_a01d_any_07","Tray tables up, we're in for turbulence!"
"plt_a01d_any_08","Whoa, whoa! Controls aren't responding!"
"plt_a01d_any_09","They're shooting us full of holes!"
"plt_a03b_any_01","... Just sit tight."
"plt_a03b_any_04","... We're good."
"plt_a03b_any_08","... Yeah, we're good."
"plt_a04a_any_02","There in three."
"plt_a04a_any_05","There in 3 minutes."
"plt_a04b_any_05","... Flying as fast as I can."
"plt_a06a_any_04","Just a minute more till I get there!"
"plt_a06b_any_02","Got this bucket of bolts pinned!"
"plt_a06b_any_04","Make sure you're ready!"
"plt_a07a_any_04","Just 30 seconds left!"
"plt_a07b_any_01","Be ready!"
"plt_a08a_any_03","I'm where we said we'd meet!"
"plt_a08b_any_05","Move! Move!"
"plt_a12_any_03","Get those bags here!"
"plt_a14_any_02","Alright, two!"
"plt_a15_any_01","Three bags!"
"plt_a15_any_02","OK, three!"
"plt_a16_any_02","Alright, four!"
"plt_a17_any_01","That's five bags!"
"plt_a21_any_01","That's nine bags!"
"plt_a25_any_01","That's 13 bags!"
"plt_a28_any_01","We got 16!"
"plt_a31_any_01","19 bags!"
"plt_a33_any_02","Only one left now!"
"plt_a34_any_01","Two more!"
"plt_a36_any_02","Four left now!"
"plt_a53a_any_03","Looks like enough to me..."
"plt_a53b_any_04","... more bags would be even better, if you can handle it..."
"plt_a54a_any_02","That's every single one of 'em! Great!"
"plt_a54a_any_03","That's the last one! Perfect!"
"plt_a55_any_03","I'm gonna get hosed if I stay here."
"plt_a57_any_01","I'm off in one minute."
"plt_a57_any_02","Maybe I can wait a minute... Maybe."
"plt_a57_any_04","One more minute, then I gotta take off!"
"plt_a58_any_03","I'm leaving in half a minute!"
"plt_a59_any_02","You have ten seconds."
"plt_a59_any_03","I'm out in ten! Ten seconds and I leave!"
"plt_a59_any_06","I'm leaving any second now!"
"plt_a60a_any_03","Time's up, I'm leaving!"
"plt_a60a_any_05","I'm getting the hell outta dodge!"
"plt_a62_any_04","They're on me! I'm naked as a jaybird!"
"plt_a63_any_01","... get 'em off of me!"
"plt_a65_any_07","Careful! Careful!"
"plt_a66_any_04","Guys, I'm on my way back in!"
"plt_al1_01_05","Okay, here's it, clowns. Get that money over here."
"plt_al1_01_07","Not exactly incon-fucking-spicuous over here. Hurry!"
"plt_al1_02_04","Nice. Come on, keep throwing it in."
"plt_al1_03_07","Crap, heavy reinforcements moving in. You guys better jump in with the loot if you wanna get out of here."
"plt_al1_03_08","Oh man. Oh man! I see cops to the horizon. Forget fighting your way out. Jump into the container - we fly out!"
"plt_as1_02_03","Authorities are trying to boost my bird. But injured civs don't pay so well. I'll be with you in 2."
"plt_as1_03_01","Dust is thick. Hard to see shit. I'm one minute out."
"plt_as1_04_03","All right, there's the flare. Beginning descent."
"plt_chw_01_01","Gentlemen, I see an opening for me to come in a short period of time. If you have any loot to secure, now is the time. I'll be at the back of the train."
"plt_chw_02_01","I'm here. Bring me the loot pronto, because I can't stay too long."
"plt_chw_intro_01","All right cowboys, I'm dropping you off here, and I'll circle around until you call me back to pick up the goods."
"plt_chw_intro_02","This feels like something out from a cowboy movie and Bile likes it, gentlemen! Anyhow, here's where I drop you off. I'll be on standby until you give me the signal to come back and pick up the loot."
"plt_flt_01_03","All right, I'm close now, but there's snipers spread around the drop zone. I'll need you to take care of those before I can drop the C4."
"plt_flt_02_03","Hey! I'm getting peppered over here! As long as the snipers are breathing, I can't get close enough to make the drop!"
"plt_flt_05_03","I apologize, gentlemen. I accidently dropped the C4 on the balcony... Sorry."
"plt_flt_07_01","Okay, I'm back, but I can't do shit with that many cops everywhere. You'll need to clear the roof."
"plt_flt_07_03","I'm here, guys, but I can't come closer as long as the roof is filled with cops."
"plt_flt_11_03","The winch is where it needs to be, but I need your help attaching the magnet."
"plt_flt_13_02","Going in. "
"plt_flt_15_02","This place is getting too hot. I'll come back when the coast is clear!"
"plt_mad_02_02","I dropped some C4 in a rush, look around for them."
"plt_mad_04_01","I see that you have disabled the guns! Hold on, I'm coming with the EMP."
"plt_mad_06_01","Huh, well it's on the outside. Should work anyway right?"
"plt_mad_intro_02","Shit! These bastards have anti-air defenses set up! I will turn the plane around! Comrads, use the parachutes and get out! We'll figure something out!"
"plt_mallcrash_a03_any","Guys, break the windows so I can send down the ladder, over."
"plt_pt2_03_03","About 60 seconds. AKA a minute."
"plt_pt2_05_02","All right, I see you. Dropping the cage by the silo."
"plt_pt2_06_03","Got a nice clear run at the bridge. That's where the cage'll be."
"plt_pt2_07_02","Okay, lining up on the road. Gonna drop the cage there."
"plt_pt2_08_01","The skyhook cage is on the ground!"
"plt_pt2_09_03","Copy that, In holding pattern til you give clearance."
"plt_pt2_12_01","And....got it. I got it! I can't believe I got it."
"plt_pt2_14_01","Okay. Here we go again. This is for the money, baby!"
"plt_pt2_17_03","Copy that. Returning for another drop. I need half a minute!"
"plt_pt2_18_02","Going to leave this one at the silo! "
"plt_pt2_20_02","I'm going to drop it on the road. Stand by."
"plt_pt2_21_03","Cage delivered!"
"plt_pt2_24_02","Okay, got eyes on the cage. Here I come!"
"plt_rats_stage3_16_any_02","Fuck, to much damage, I have to leave, coming back!"
"plt_run_01_01","Ok guys... the buildings here make it hard to get close. You need to move to a higher position so I can pick you up."
"plt_run_01_02","Can you move up to a higher point? It's hard to get in close where you are now."
"plt_run_02_01","It's very hairy here. I'll move to a safer spot, guys. Follow me."
"plt_run_02_03","I'll try another spot where it's less hot. Follow me."
"plt_run_03_01","Ok, I'm here and ready to get the hell out."
"plt_run_03_02","Alright, get on board so we can get the hell out of here."
"plt_run_04_01","I can't pick you up with all these cops around here. You need to clear the area."
"plt_run_04_02","You need to clear the pickup zone guys! Or I won't be able to get you out."
"plt_run_05_03","Clear skies. I'm coming in."
"plt_run_07_02","I'll deploy over here where it's less hairy."
"plt_run_09_01","Get him into the chopper. I can't hang around here forever."
"plt_watchdogs_stage1_01_any_01","Hang tight boys."
"plt_watchdogs_stage1_02_any_01","Alright, I'm ready, get everyone in the chopper!"
"plt_watchdogs_stage1_04_any_01","Let's get the fuck out of here."
"plt_watchdogs_stage1_04_any_02","We're leaving."
"pmn_pal_01_04","I don't want to die."
"pon_man_02_01","Stay still and put your hands in the air."
"pon_man_02_07","Stop and give up, your escape is blocked."
"pon_man_03_03","Mr Sturr. Comply or we will be forced to take you down."
"pon_man_04_02","An agent will now detain you."
"pon_man_05_03","Mr Sturr. Don't give them anything."
"pon_man_07_01","Mr Sturr, we will get you outta' there."
"pon_man_07_02","Mr Sturr we will get you out."
"pon_man_09_01","Up top, move people, let's secure alpha one!"
"pt1_cr3_01_02","You ready for it? I'm dropping the hose."
"pt1_cr3_03_02","That's all I got. I'm outta here!"

"pt1_fri_01_02","I don't even wanna know what you guys are up to this time. Just give me the coordinates."
"pt1_fri_02_02","Be there in a few minutes. Stand by."
"pt1_fri_03_01","Ok guys, I'm here. So we need to wreck these cars, right? Let's drop this sucker in the water. Attach the magnet!"
"pt1_fri_03_02","Ok guys. Busting cars I hear. Attach the magnet - this one's going for a swim!"
"pt1_fri_04_02","And... off we go!"
"pt1_fri_04_03","Got it! I always liked to play with cars as a kid..."
"pt1_fri_05_02","There she blows!"
"pt1_fri_05_03","Hey guys - did you see the splash it made?"
"pt1_fri_07_03","Ok guys, attach the next one."

"rb22_des_cbf_01","Henry's Rock. Every crackball conspiracy theory you've ever heard about classified scientific experiments and corporate occult rascality, gathered in one facility. Locke says that Murkywater's top men are up to some rather nefarious skullduggery there. Security footage we hacked shows they have two more gilded cases like the one Commissioner Garrett had in FBI lockup. One of them may even be the very same piece we recovered for the Dentist in Vegas. It isn't clear yet how they connect to Bain's search, but they're obviously important enough to the Murkies that we should probably take them off their hands, and maybe serve them a little comeuppance while we're at it."

"rb4_sh11_05_01","Man, aren't we feisty today?"
"rb4_sh11_05_02","Jeez, don't lose your head, Bain."
"rb4_sh11_05_03","Well excuse me for not noticing it while I took down the guard."
"rb4_sh11_07_03","Ah shit!"
"rb4_sh11_08_01","Jesus Christ... that was a little too close..."
"rb4_sh11_10_01","Okay, I got it. Are we done with this shit?"
"rb4_sh12_01_01","Okay, Bain. Let's get this shit over with."
"rb4_sh12_01_02","Let's finish this, Bain."
"rb4_sh12_03_02","Ok, I can see the door but I also see a camera."
"rb4_sh12_03_03","That's the door, but it's guarded by a camera."
"rb4_sh12_04_02","Well, this was harder than I remembered it to be."
"rb4_sh12_05_02","Suck it!"
"rb4_sh12_06_02","Heavy motherfucker."
"rb4_sh12_06_03","Damn, he's heavy..."
"rb4_sh12_08_03","I'm outside the security room but I need a keycard."
"rb4_sh12_09_01","Okay, I got the keycard."
"rb4_sh12_09_02","I got the keycard."
"rb4_sh12_09_03","I found the keycard."
"rb4_sh12_11_01","Okay... more guards in the lobby."
"rb4_sh12_12_01","Hey! I think I see it. Yeah, that should be the computer we're after. And I think it's close by."
"rb4_sh12_12_03","Well, hello there gorgeous... Bain, I found the laptop. It should be close by."
"rb4_sh12_13_03","There's another guard here."
"rb4_sh12_14_02","I see the computer, and no guards. Lucky day."
"rb4_sh12_17_01","Okay. I'm outside. We're good to go, right?"
"rb4_sh12_17_02","All right, I made it outside in one piece."
"rb4_sh12_17_03","Bain, I'm outside now."
"rb4_sh21_01_03","Rock and roll, baby."
"rb4_sh21_02_02","Fuck yeah. This is mine."
"rb4_sh21_03_01","Fuck me, Bain. We still usin' these shitty ass-drills that keep jamming?"
"rb4_sh21_04_01","It's all part of the job, isn't it?"
"rb4_sh21_04_03","Okay, let's do this then!"
"rb4_sh21_06_02","Come on, you really thought I couldn't get this shit done?"
"rb4_sh22_03_01","You better make it happen, Bain. I'm not losing one of my guys over this rookie-ass mission."
"rb4_sh22_03_02","You better make the deal go through, Bain. I'll not fucking lose one of my friends over this little test of yours."
"rb4_sh22_03_03","How's it going? I swear to God, Bain, you better make a deal happen. I'll not see one of my friends behind bars because you wanted to see if I still got what it takes."
"rb4_sh22_05_01","Of course I still got it. You better give us something with a bigger payday next time."
"rb5_bph_intro_01g","Right, wankers. We do this one for the boss."
"rb5_bph_intro_02b","I hope that piece-of-shit traitor Kento is up there. I really do."
"rb5_bph_intro_03b","All of this has happened before. Fuck me."
"rb5_hb1_01_01","Fucking hell. Me ears are bolloxed. Was that C4 or a demolition charge?"
"rb5_hb1_01_02","Fuck me, talk about making an entrance."
"rb5_hb1_01_08","Yes! Yes! Now it's time to see helmets flying!"
"rb5_hb1_02_01","Dunno what Bain was thinking, but we're making a detour. Got something in mind."
"rb5_hb1_03_07","I know I was betrayed. I'll find who fuckin' did it."
"rb5_hb1_04_08","I'll miss the slags I left behind. Mickey the Squib. Dirty Alan. Fish Fingers. Good lads."
"rb5_hb1_04_11","Feels good to be outside. The fresh air, the birds... The bullets, and explosions, and all that shit."
"rb5_hb1_04_12","At least in the nick I didn't have Bain yapping in my ear, like a little needy dog. Get the drill, my arse."
"rb5_hb1_04_16","Dallas, I thought we were pals. Does a pal leave his BFF in jail? Wanker."
"rb5_hb1_04_19","Wolf, you've been barking up the wrong tree for years! And now you find me!"
"rb5_hb1_04_20","Wolf, what you did with that Bulldozer back there was a bit... I think you need help, mate."
"rb5_hb1_04_25","Well fuck me sideways, if it isn't John Wick. I thought you got out? How's the family? What, did I say something bad?"
"rb5_hb1_05_01","I said it's fucking payday motherfuckers!"
"rb5_hb2_01_01","Move! Last one in's a nonce!"
"rb5_hb2_02_03","Operations is our first stop. From there, we should be able to find what we need."
"rb5_hb2_03_01","Here! I'm getting to that server. Kill every last fucker ya see!"
"rb5_hb2_05_01","Shite! Small problem - server's heavily encrypted. The encryption keys are kept in the Security Office. You need to grab them and bring them back here!"
"rb5_hb2_07_02","You're in. Ha! His password was: iheartrainbows44. The requests are on the way. Approve them!"
"rb5_hb2_08_02","Keep yer knickers on, lads. Need to find all the files for ya to sign off."
"rb5_hb2_08_03","Hold on, fellas. Just finding the files for ya."
"rb5_hb2_09_02","Alright, just approve that request. Fuck me, he's got an easy job."
"rb5_hb2_09_03","Another request for you to sign off on."
"rb5_hb2_12_03","Ah, come on! We're missing a server. According to the log, it was taken to IT. Get over there, and grab it."
"rb5_hb2_14_01","OK, I've copied all the information I found to this server. Grab the server and let's get out of here."
"rb5_hb2_14_03","That's as much as we can do here. I saved all the intel on this server. Grab it and let's get out and see if we can make sense of this. "
"rb5_hb2_16_02","Got power again, fellas. Need a sec to reboot this."
"rb5_hb2_18_02","Got my file. Let's see what they have on me."
"rb5_hb2_20_01","This isn't an average case. Lots of information restricted. I'm not this important, am I?"
"rb5_hb2_20_02","This case is special. Why am I special? Who's leaking this stuff?"
"rb5_hb2_21_01","Man, this case goes a lot further than just me. There's references to all you guys in here. No names though. Guess our rat is sitting on those."
"rb5_hb2_22_02","Alright, I'm wrapping up in here, almost done. There'll be lots of info to sort through. But we're going to find that arsehole. Silence him before he squeals."
"rb5_hb2_23_01","I'll keep schtum in here til you're back."
"rb5_hb2_24_01","Back to work, keep me covered."
"rb5_hb2_24_02","I'll get to work. Cover me!"
"rb5_hb2_brf_01_01","Well, lads, thanks for breakin' me out. But I shouldn't have been there to begin with. Someone set me up. I'm sure of it. The Feds had too much on me. Way more than those mingebag wankers could dig up. Someone ratted. Someone fucked me. And I'm gonna find out who.$NL;$NL;Now, it ain't gonna be easy. No fannying about around the edges, right? No shadowy deals or contacts, or that bollocks. We're going to the source. The biggest FBI nest. Gonna find out who screwed me."
"rb5_hb2_end_01_02","Thanks guys, I'm glad to be back. We've got a shitload of intel that I need to go through. Hopefully it's enough so we can find whoever ratted me out, that backstabbing cunt.$NL;$NL;Isn't there something like a thieves code or some bollocks? I'll tell you guys as soon as I find anything worth sharing. We'll find this wanker, and when we do, he'll be sorry he fucked with the Payday Gang."
"rb5_hb2_intro_01_01b","Fuckin' nice one."

"subtitles_0413","OK, the airport is just down the hill. Cut through the fence and find the hangar where the truck holding the cases is. The FBI is of course, on scene. Get Vlad's guns and bring em here."
"subtitles_0414","Go in through the fence, find the guns and bring them back here. Prepare to fight and fight hard. Let's do this."
"subtitles_0415","The FBI is holding the trucks and the guns. Find the warehouse they keep the truck in. Hit the FBI hard and make it back here with the guns. Best of luck, sorry about the mess."
"subtitles_0416","OK we're good to go. I'll get you guys clear to the safe house. We have the guns to keep Vlad happy. And I'm sure it'll go over great with him. The FBI... Are another matter."
"subtitles_0417","Well executed. Guns secured and Vlad is preparing the money for us. Let's cash in."
"subtitles_0419","You guys never disappoint. Full house gentlemen. Vlad will be proud of this work. We are in business for real."

"subtitles_0474","I don't what kind of loot we're talking about so be ready for anything. Use the van to make your escape."
"subtitles_0475","Turns out the bank manager here should have kept his mouth shut - one of our guys overheard him bragging about how great the security is there, unblemished record, blah blah blah. "
"subtitles_0480","Let's go in there and take all the little square packages we can find. It will be a lot of money I'm sure. "
"subtitles_0490","Robbery time. Keep the civilians in check, don't let 'em use phones, watch for cameras. See you at the van."
"subtitles_0497","OK crew, that's the target. Get those people on the floor, hit those cameras, get your drill going. See you at the spot."
"subtitles_0499","Roll in there like the tide, they won't know what hit 'em. Get that drill up fast, they'll start calling you an EVIL team..."
"subtitles_0500","Now this is no First World bank, small and compact, you should be able to do this thing in ten minutes. Just keep cool and we all win."

"subtitles_0835","Thats one, seven left."
"subtitles_0836","That's 2."

"subtitles_0844","There should be more weapon caches somewhere, see if you can find them."
"subtitles_0846","Don't lose sight of the plan... Those caches still need to get destroyed!"
"subtitles_0847","Don't forget about the caches!"
"subtitles_0849","You can use the "higher-ups" keycard to open up the doors."
"subtitles_0851","We're good, escape's clear!"
"subtitles_0852","Whoa... Wait, that fence is electrified."
"subtitles_0857","Find the weapons and destroy them. Easy."
"subtitles_0858","Great, law enforcement - probably tailing the gangsters. Better and better."
"subtitles_0859","Great, SWAT - following the gangsters probably!"
"subtitles_0860","You found a stash! Bag it up and destroy them."
"subtitles_0862","Might be a little something in the safes..."
"subtitles_0863","There's probably some in the safes."
"subtitles_0864","The chiefs are fleeing."
"subtitles_0866","Both the chiefs got away."
"subtitles_0870","The office will be highly guarded, so keep your eyes open for guards and cameras."
"subtitles_0871","We need to locate the position of the server room, sneak inside and disable the alarm for the door, so that we can get in unnoticed."
"subtitles_0872","So what we need to do is, locate the server room, sneak in, then disable the door alarm. After that, we roll in like the tide."
"subtitles_0880","Government offices... Never good."
"subtitles_0888","Biting my nails up here folks, but so far so good."
"subtitles_0891","OK good. Let's find that server room."
"subtitles_0892","Beautiful, they're still in the dark."
"subtitles_0910","Get the damn door open, no need to be careful."
"subtitles_0915","I'm in... Good work. Gimme a second here."
"subtitles_0933","Get that last door open then go get the server."
"subtitles_0936","OK...OK... Just need to get the server out of its housing and walk it to the van."
"subtitles_0937","Just get the server clear of its housing and take it to the van..."
"subtitles_0941","You guys are so close. Don't get sloppy now."
"subtitles_0947","There goes the alarm, kick it into plan B people."
"subtitles_0950","Shit! Was really hoping we wouldn't need to go to plan B here!"
"subtitles_0960","Watch the server room door... If someone comes near you might need to take care of them."
"subtitles_0961","Bring it home fellas. So goddam close I can taste it. "
"subtitles_0962","This is going to be a good one."
"subtitles_0963","Move that server! Move it! Come on! "
"subtitles_0974","Go on and find... What..."
"subtitles_0976","Could be the cartel... "
"subtitles_0982","This is not the plan..."
"subtitles_0985","OK listen up. You will do the cook for Hector. He will be grateful, trust me."
"subtitles_0986","You need to find the materials. "
"subtitles_0989","Now I don't want to worry you. But if you mess up... It would be bad."
"subtitles_1009","Thing is they have to be added in the right order..."
"subtitles_1013","OK, add muriatic acid to keep the reaction going."
"subtitles_1015","Muriatic acid will be in a greenish gas can looking thing..."
"subtitles_1021","Search around for the caustic soda."
"subtitles_1022","These idiots must have had it here somewhere."
"subtitles_1026","The hydrogen chloride should be in a metal tank..."
"subtitles_1030","Search around for it, it has to be there..."
"subtitles_1031","Search around for the hydrogen chloride."
"subtitles_1046","They're inside!"
"subtitles_1047","They're breaching the house!"
"subtitles_1066","Ambush! Feds are moving in for the bust!"
"subtitles_1086","Be on your toes. "
"subtitles_1087","Keep your eyes open."
"subtitles_1090","Well those look like FBI heavy units. Watch yourself."
"subtitles_1098","You might as well take that cash. My guess is they probably left a present."
"subtitles_1109","How lucky are you feeling? There's still that money in the bus..."
"subtitles_1110","Yeah, I guess we got their attention, we have law enforcement on the way..."
"subtitles_1125","Bag it up so we can continue cooking, and get the bag to the van."
"subtitles_1127","OK folks, the trucks are about to go. Find out which one has the ballot machines and get the GPS on it. Gotta be a clue around there."
"subtitles_1128","Any luck? Keep your eyes open for anything, a sign... Something."
"subtitles_1129","Obvious, but keep a low profile. We don't need the heat."
"subtitles_1131","Lot of guards. Heads up."
"subtitles_1133","OK well you still need to figure out which one it is and get that tracker on the bottom of the truck... Or get out."
"subtitles_1142","OK that's it. Let's sneak out of here and see what's what."
"subtitles_1145","Ah... Well that's going to get everyones attention..."
"subtitles_1151","Guns out on this one fellas. "
"subtitles_1159","Yep, this is it. Get it open."
"subtitles_1164","They're still in the dark, great."
"subtitles_1166","Drill or saw... Maybe you have a more exotic way to get in here I dunno."
"subtitles_1169","This should look like a regular robbery... As regular as this can look. Keep them away from the hacking device."
"subtitles_1170","Keep 'em away from the truck we're hacking to be safe."
"subtitles_1178","OK here we go."
"subtitles_1182","I wish we had some goddamn equipment that worked... Start it again."
"subtitles_1189","Go get the gas can from the truck and burn the truck. Make it look like an accident or something. What a mess."
"subtitles_1194","Truck's burning. If you haven't already, you can clean out the other trucks and then make your escape. Hurry it up."
"subtitles_1200","OK, the truck's open, get our goods out."
"subtitles_1227","Come on, get that vault open."
"subtitles_1232","Open sesame. Now let's see what we have there."
"subtitles_1244","That'll keep them from seeing our business. Good."
"subtitles_1247","There are bandit barriers in the bank - you can close 'em from the security office. Will help keep cops out of your area of operation."
"subtitles_1252","So far so good people."
"subtitles_1253","I love your focus... They haven't made you yet."
"subtitles_1263","They're going to be expecting us. These are not good people."
"subtitles_1267","Watch yourself."
"subtitles_1268","We just need to get this before they do. We don't want them burning information we can use."
"subtitles_1272","Must be there somewhere..."
"subtitles_1275","The safe's gotta be there somewhere, these clowns aren't smart enough to put it in storage."
"subtitles_1276","Have you found the safe yet? The address got to be in there."
"subtitles_1278","You found it. Now get it open and get that address."
"subtitles_1285","They're trying to... They just torched a piece of intel. We could have used that."
"subtitles_1298","Right on time... "
"subtitles_1299","Was hoping we'd do this without police for once."
"subtitles_1302","They've mined the place! Watch your step!"
"subtitles_1310","Now you got us the lead we needed. Get out when you're ready."
"subtitles_1311","You think you can keep it quiet? Kudos, guys."
"subtitles_1312","Well it's on now. Deal with these meatheads. Get our stuff. Get out."
"subtitles_1313","Dammit, they're burning the intel."
"subtitles_1314","Nice place. Mr Cold Fusion's summer house. Huh."
"subtitles_1315","Our inventor's summer place. I guess big oil doesn't like this much."
"subtitles_1319","OK... Try to keep it down long as you can..."
"subtitles_1323","Remember you're looking for the server room."
"subtitles_1326","OK, this is the server room. Get in and let's get access to the computer."
"subtitles_1329","Well now we're on their clock."
"subtitles_1339","Server just lost power... We need it back to continue!"
"subtitles_1342","Power just went out... You need to find the circuit breaker."
"subtitles_1348","Terrific. Let's get that lab door open and see what progress looks like."
"subtitles_1350","Uh... That's... More prototypes than I thought... How many is that..."
"subtitles_1351","Holy... This place is bigger than we thought. You've got your work cut out for you down there."
"subtitles_1354","If you can't figure out which one just bring one up and hopefully we get lucky... Otherwise... This is gonna be a long goddamn day."
"subtitles_1358","OK, we got it, hang on a little longer."
"subtitles_1366","Outputs seem clean... Couple more checks and we'll know what we got."
"subtitles_1367","Looks like we're out of luck. This one's no good. Go get me another. Look harder. Guess better. Don't care. Just get it."
"subtitles_1371","Really hoping this one works out."
"subtitles_1372","OK... Outputs... No.. Goddammit... Just a second..."
"subtitles_1374","No joy. Just not our day I guess. Go get another."
"subtitles_1377","I really thought we had it this time. God dammit I've lost count. Go get another."
"subtitles_1378","No... Not this one either. The levels seemed better, too. Go get another one."
"subtitles_1379","Wait... Wait... Wait... NO. Dammit I can't take anymore of this. Try again. You're narrowing it down at least."
"subtitles_1382","Aha! That's it! Cold fusion, right here. I'll just cozy up to this and you folks head for the hills."
"subtitles_1391","Great - this is it..."
"subtitles_1399","OK, I'm coming in, get the engine ready."
"subtitles_1405","Good day for a jewelry hit. I'd recommend casing the joint before you hit it, though."
"subtitles_1407","Here we go. That tiara should be in there somewhere folks."
"subtitles_1411","...You're looking good so far."
"subtitles_1414","...You might actually pull this off..."
"subtitles_1415","You've still got the element of surprise."
"subtitles_1417","That's it, so much for the quiet route!"
"subtitles_1418","OK, Plan B time!"
"subtitles_1419","You want Plan B, you got it!"
"subtitles_1423","Tiara's gotta be there folks. Keep looking."
"subtitles_1424","No luck yet?"
"subtitles_1428","That looks like the safe... Get it open."
"subtitles_1429","Think that's the safe. Pop it."
"subtitles_1430","OK... Control the room..."
"subtitles_1431","Watch the exits... No cell phones..."
"subtitles_1433","Cops in the back!"
"subtitles_1437","They got the 211 call... Cops are here..."
"subtitles_1438","Still stealthy, I'll be damned."
"subtitles_1484","This is a perfect heist so far folks. I wish I had filmed it."
"subtitles_1486","Hell of a job so far. Now you just need to get out."
"subtitles_1501","The display cases are full..."
"subtitles_1502","Check in the back too."
"subtitles_1503","Check the back too."
"subtitles_1505","Almost enough."
"subtitles_1510","OK, so this is an easy job to get accustomed to DC."
"subtitles_1512","Loot the stores in this little strip mall. "
"subtitles_1514","Gather up... Say at least 15k and then I'll get the driver to pick you guys up. "
"subtitles_1515","Get the cash amount we agreed on and I'll send the driver. More than that is gravy."
"subtitles_1517","Sound good? Let's go!"
"subtitles_1528","You gathered a bag full of stuff? Ill get a guy to come pick that up. Expect him soon."
"subtitles_1531","The pick-up driver is here now, go get that loot in the back of the truck!"
"subtitles_1532","That's the driver, throw the loot into the back of his truck."
"subtitles_1533","OK that's our guy. Get the loot into the vehicle."
"subtitles_1534","He'll leave for now, if you manage to find something else, I'll get him to return for you."
"subtitles_1540","I'll be there in two minutes."
"subtitles_1545","OK, this should be entertaining. It's a nightclub hit."
"subtitles_1551","Old world guy... Doesn't trust banks."
"subtitles_1553","Go on in and find the office - safe should be there."
"subtitles_1555","That's the office up there. "
"subtitles_1559","Maybe there's a back way up there."
"subtitles_1561","Watch the room folks..."
"subtitles_1565","Too many dicks on the dancefloor..."
"subtitles_1568","This is it. Get the safe open."
"subtitles_1570","Come on with the safe... This club's gonna look like Beirut in about 3 minutes."
"subtitles_1572","That's it. Beautiful. Bag it and move it."
"subtitles_1574","Lovely. Get it out of there."
"subtitles_1589","OK make your run! Go! Go!"
"subtitles_1600","Are you guys comin? Hurry!"
"subtitles_1603","Have you found the key yet?"
"subtitles_1604","OK, the owner of this mall stopped paying Vlad protection money. His mistake."
"subtitles_1608","So. We trash the place. Do as much damage as we can."
"subtitles_1610","To show just how serious Vlad is, we're gonna destroy 50 grand worth of pretty things."
"subtitles_1612","Vlad's looking for us to destroy the requested amount. I know you're not an accountant, but you know, guess."
"subtitles_1616","Check closets, etc. Just do damage."
"subtitles_1618","Cops in the mall! "
"subtitles_1619","We got cops in the mall folks!"
"subtitles_1641","I think they'll understand Vlad's position better now. And pay up..."
"subtitles_1658","OK guys, I'm coming back now to pick you guys up."
"subtitles_1661","Help! They're shooting at me!"
"subtitles_1666","Get down there and locate those guns."
"subtitles_1678","This place is dry, get back to the van."
"subtitles_1679","OK, you guys totally emptied that hangar, time to get out of here."
"subtitles_1681","Nice work boys."
"subtitles_1741","It's open! Search through the deposit boxes!"
"subtitles_1747","OK. Time to burn some money."
"subtitles_1750","I keep losing my com connection. Strange."
"subtitles_1752","You know the drill. Make this work. "
"subtitles_1755","Well that's a wrinkle. They're running current through the vault!"
"subtitles_1756","We need to find the generator powering that thing... Gotta be around here."
"subtitles_1758","There must be a generator juicing that door. Find it."
"subtitles_1759","These cartel guys aren't taking any chances, they wired up the door with electricity. "
"subtitles_1761","OK, power's down. No more shocks. I hope."
"subtitles_1766","Hector wants this recorded. Don't ask, I didn't."
"subtitles_1767","OK, get the camera set up and record it. "
"subtitles_1771","Burn it all. Most of it is marked anyway, the feds would be all over us."
"subtitles_1773","It's burning? Good, good, good..."
"subtitles_1777","Let it burn. Start opening up those deposit boxes if you want a little extra. I mean when in Rome..."
"subtitles_1793","Wow... You're doing great..."
"subtitles_1798","Dammit... This is bad..."
"subtitles_1799","OK... Nearest place... Checking..."
"subtitles_1803","Try the park. Think there's cover there."
"subtitles_1820","30 seconds... Hold on."
"subtitles_1847","Don't give up..."
"subtitles_1852","Tactical chopper incoming. Here we go."
"subtitles_1855","Looks like they got a sniper setting up nearby the overpass..."
"subtitles_1858","Just keep it together gents... Don't lose hope."
"subtitles_1860","What the hell just happened?! Just grab the loot and look alive! The cops are moving in."

"trai_intro_03_03","Hot damn! Y'all are big leagues! What's next? Fort Knox? Ha, the goddamn White House? Can you imagine?"
"txm_man_01_02","It's somewhere close. I wanna see the funds. "
"txm_man_01_03","It's close by, but I wanna see the funds. "
"txm_man_02_02","... Excellent. I'll get the server. "
"txm_man_03_01","Huh, where the fuck am I?"
"txm_man_04_03","No, I'm afraid!"

"txm_man_10_03","What! Just leave me alone!"

"vld_as1_03_02","Stop admiring the sights and find those trucks!"
"vld_as1_03_03","Hey, you assholes taking some sun? The trucks, remember?!"
"vld_as1_04_02","Slice those trucks open, my friends."
"vld_as1_05_01","Yes! Good, there are the safes. My babies. My 400lb babies. They'll break your backs if you try to carry them away. Look for a transport."
"vld_as1_08_04","These Californians are so rude. Teach them some DC manners."
"vld_as1_08_05","They'll be digging chunks of cop out of the rubble for weeks!"
"vld_as1_08_08","Bringing west coast safes to my east coast players!"

"vld_as1_10_02","Few walls left standing after the earthquake...had to be these ones. Blow the fucking things."
"vld_as1_10_03","You're not going to let a little thing like a wall stand in your way, are you?"
"vld_as1_11_01","Great. That's the first truck emptied. How are your backs feeling?"
"vld_as1_12_01","How many safes is that? A quarter? Keep going."
"vld_as1_12_02","I know you're muscles are aching, but keep lifting those safes."
"vld_as1_12_03","The safes are heavy, yes I know, but this is good exercise."
"vld_as1_13_01","That's half of the safes out of the trucks. Half way there!"
"vld_as1_13_02","Don't slacken off now, yes? "
"vld_as1_13_03","Good, good."
"vld_as1_14_03","Good, good. Don't surrender now. "
"vld_as1_15_01","Not going to risk driving them out. Got the pilot headed back, but he can't see you cos of all the dust and smoke. Light a flare for him!"
"vld_as1_15_02","The roads are too damned jammed with useless things like ambulances, and other shit like that. We're flying you out. Light a flare so the pilot can see you."
"vld_as1_16_03","Get in the truck, all of you. There's cookies and candy inside, I promise."
"vld_as1_17_03","Even Mother Nature couldn't stop Vlad Or the Payday Gang! "
"vld_as1_cbf_01_01","I've struck a deal with the biggest syndicate on the west Coast, selling their safes on the east Coast.

"vld_bex_03_01","I'm gonna keep my eye on you. This one is important to Vlad."
"vld_bex_04_01","You think they have lots of goats in Mexico?"
"vld_bex_06_01","Again with the animals? What is it with you and animals? Who gives a shit?"
"vld_bex_07_01","Good thing Vlad sent you that thermite to use, eh!"
"vld_bex_08_01b","I have been in the bank one time, a few years ago. The bank manager is an idiot. He keeps his access key in a personal safe, but I don't remember where."

"
"vld_bex_11_01","This is like when Vlad was younger, but much less shooting. Incredible, no one is dead yet."
"vld_bex_13_01b","Hurry up, I want to see that my merchandise is OK."
"vld_bex_14_01b","Ah, there is my beautiful merchandise! Nice, nice very nice. Ah, That makes Vlad very happy. aahh, Take it, Take it, Take it, Take it!"
"vld_bex_15_01","Ah, There are my precious things! Hurry, Hurry, take them!"
"vld_bex_15_02","You know the Romanovs, eh?"
"vld_bex_15_03","You got... Is old family thing. Don't you mind... just get it out of there!"
"vld_bex_16_02","It's... Is old family things. Don't you pay attention to it..."
"vld_bex_16_02a","My brother-in-law. You remember him, yes? He came down from a party in Chihuahua to help!"
"vld_bex_18_01","Oh wow, I really thought that would work!"
"vld_bex_18_02","Oh...That looks... Ohoyoyoyo... That looks, not very good.
"
"vld_bex_19_01","Is he dead? Oh sh... my wife will give me an earful at dinner if he is."
"vld_bex_20_01a","Guys, you better tell my brother-in-law to step on it!"
"vld_bex_22_01","I, I don't understand, why don't you just hack the computers?"
"vld_bex_23_01","If he gives you any trouble, break some fingers."
"vld_bex_24_01","What are you doing leading him around? Just hit him in the head with a maracas or something and he will talk."
"vld_bex_24_02","I still think he will do better with a hit in the head."
"vld_bex_25_01","Ugh, How slow is this guy?
"
"vld_bex_27_01b","Ugh, Why is it taking so long?"
"vld_bex_28_01","I... I'm telling you. Ukraine makes the best drills. Next time Locky, buy one from there and it will not break."
"vld_bex_30_02","You know, these mexican cops are smarter than they look.
"
"vld_bex_intro_01_00","Hey! Heey! Hey Hey Heeey! Locky!"
"vld_bex_intro_01_02","Don't worry Locky, Vlad will be quiet as mouse drinking Sputniks!"
"vld_can_01_02","Merrrrrrrry Christmas!"
"vld_can_01_03","Jingle their motherfucking bells!"
"vld_can_02_02","All right, drop those thugs before they can steal Christmas. Then into the workshop."
"vld_can_04_02","Someone always wants to fuck my Christmas! Here come the cops. Don't let them screw the elves, yes?"
"vld_can_04_03","Damn cops. They're the ghost of Christmas fuck! Deal with them! Protect the elves! At all costs, protect the elves!"
"vld_can_05_01","Nice! Now, where do presents go? Into the chimney!"
"vld_can_06_01","Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow...."
"vld_can_06_05","You've made Vlad happy. Here, have this!"
"vld_can_06_06","You've been good little heisters. Here, have a gift."
"vld_can_07_02","The elves are slowing down. Go and tell them about the dental plan we offer. Work harder, or get your fucking teeth smashed in!"
"vld_can_07_03","Tell the elves to work harder, or the only thing they'll get in their stocking is my fist in their ass!"
"vld_can_07_06","Are those elves working as hard as they can? Perhaps you can "motivate" them?"
"vld_can_08_01","They're dead. All of them. Every elf. Dead. What the hell kind of Christmas story is this?"
"vld_can_08_02","Are all of the elves dead? Shit. Christmas is cancelled, my friends. "
"vld_can_09_02","That's enough to keep Christmas cheery. But, you know, you want to keep those elves churning out goodies, I can always spread a little more cheer, you understand? Or you can leave. Up to you."
"vld_can_09_03","Well, you can escape, sure, that's fine. Or.......here's an idea. You can stay, bully more elves and make more beautiful snow!"
"vld_can_10_02","Ahhh, there's the last elf dead. Am I sad? No, fuck that elf. We got the toys, so it's time to leave."
"vld_can_11_03","You brought gold, frankincense and myrrh. Myrrh coke to Vlad!"
"vld_can_12_01","Here, take this gift from my cousin. He said it should keep you warm!"
"vld_chca_01_02","Ah, nice! Vlad likes to eavesdrop!"
"vld_chca_02_01","Hey, how long are you guys going to run around over there? What's so hard about finding a cabin?"
"vld_chca_03_01","Hello you noodle-sucking piece of shit."
"vld_chca_04_01","Not, bad, not bad. Have you ever heard the children's story of the little girl and the dragon?"
"vld_chca_10_02","When they were torturing me, I heard them talk about this Li Deng-guy. If you get the chance, smash out his fucking gold teeth and bring them back!"
"vld_chca_12_02","Burning money demands a good cause. Crushing your enemies, driving them before you, is a very good cause."
"vld_chca_13_01","How the fuck was I supposed to know? The son of a bitch was massaging me with a fucking car battery!"
"vld_chca_14_01","That's him! That's the motherfucker that got me!"
"vld_chca_15_01","Hey, the motherfucker was burning my fucking nipples off with electricity! I didn't look at his fucking hand!"
"vld_cp1_02_01","Stop acting, you big baby. I'll jam that bottle up your ass and pin it to your fucking prostate."
"vld_cp1_02_03","Asshole! That's not snow falling. That's my fucking product. My fucking product! Thanks to you!"
"vld_cp1_03_03","He's safe. Well, for now. Hey, since you're there, if you could perhaps collect a few of those presents... I'd pay well."
"vld_cp1_04_01","I pay top dollar for any of my coke you can get in the helicopter. Top dollar!"
"vld_cp1_04_03","Any coke you guys find, just toss it in the helicopter. I pay big bucks."
"vld_cp1_05_02","Another of my packages! Find it. "
"vld_cp1_05_03","I think I just heard another package. It's mine! Look for it!"
"vld_cp1_05_04","Packages are still falling from the trees. Go! Go find them!"
"vld_cp1_05_05","Christmas presents are still falling out of the sky! Pick up as many as you can!"
"vld_cp1_05_06","Those nicely wrapped packages of coke are still coming down! Bring as many as you can!"
"vld_cp1_06_01","Oh, this is embarrassing. Maybe you could... Nah, wife would never forgive me."
"vld_cp1_06_03","Can you believe this tragic sack of crap was a hero? On your feet!"
"vld_cp1_cbf_01","My asshole brother-in-law, that useless sack of ball-skin, has crashed his plane. He hit something and ... We can't let the cops pick him up. Normally I wouldn't give two shakes of my pisser for that drunken asshole. I'd let him rot there, but, you know... Family. Track that old soak down and get him out. I'll pay a nice Christmas bonus for any of his packages too."
"vld_cp1_cnc_02","A pilot of mine has gone down in the woods. Find him, get him back here."
"vld_cp1_cnc_03","My brother-in-law crashed his plane in the woods. Get him back here."
"vld_cp1_end_01","I won't lie. Part of me was hoping that mudak was dead. But that would be too much of a Christmas miracle, eh? You did good. Have some cash."
"vld_cp1_end_02","He's back and already cleaning out my drinks cabinet. Korva. Anyway, you boys did good. You earned this."
"vld_dn1_01_01","Payday crew. Vlad. There's a marked pig in that warehouse. It's very important to me. It's for... er... present for mamma. Yes, that's it. Don't let the Feds get it. Grab it for me."
"vld_fex_07a_02","Buluc thinks he's a big showman, but is more of a slippery snake."
"vld_fex_09a_01","Hey, this piece of shit Buluc... he likes riddles and cryptic things. "
"vld_fex_09a_02","This guy has a sick sense of humor. Thinks making puzzles to open doors is good for stopping thieves."
"vld_fex_26a_04","Make him bleed! I want to hear him when he dies!"
"vld_fex_26b_06","Vlad is not a violent man. I let others do the violence and just enjoy it!"
"vld_fex_26d_01","What are you waiting for? Shoot him!"
"vld_fex_26d_02b","Shoot Him! Shooooot!"
"vld_fex_26d_05","Time to die you dirty Coyopa shit!"
"vld_fex_26e_01","That's just what I needed!"
"vld_fex_26e_03","Right into the fucking ocean!"
"vld_fex_27a_02","Before you leave, maybe break open Buluc's safe. He has lists of contacts and business assets in there. Maybe useful to make some good money after this job."
"vld_fex_30_01","You know, Buluc has some nice cars. Maybe you could take one and drive away with it?"
"vld_fex_30_02","Vlad remembers this beautiful car Buluc bought with money I helped him make. Maybe go down to the garage and take it?"
"vld_fex_30_04","These Coyopa shitheads buy a lot of nice cars with their money. You can steal one from the garage to escape with."
"vld_fex_39a_02","Maybe you should just burn the place down instead? No, he would just get away, the little rat."
"vld_fex_50_03","Ah, that hacking stuff again. More computer shit. Just find someone who knows, put his arm in a vice and he will do whatever you need!"
"vld_fex_54b_01","Oh, use that thing on Buluc's leg! Cut it right off."
"vld_fex_57a_01","Oh, I can't wait! Hey guys, make sure Buluc knows the bullet is from me, yes?"
"vld_fex_57a_03","Hey, Locky... this is great! Here, take some popcorn!"
"vld_fex_57b_01","DOSVEDANYA MOTHERFUCKER!"
"vld_fex_57b_02","Take that, you fucker!"
"vld_fex_57b_03","Bravo! Happy swimming you piece of shit!"
"vld_fex_57b_04","Say hello to the little fishes!"
"vld_fex_57_01","Make the piece of shit fall in the ocean!"
"vld_fex_57_02","Shoot the piece of shit! Wave goodbye for me!"
"vld_fex_57_03","Shoot him! Shoot him in the knee! Nononono, in the stomach! Then make him go over. "
"vld_fex_58a_01","Hey, before you go... break open that fuckers safe. Lots of things in there! Contacts, money... contracts. Very useful!"
"vld_fex_58a_02","Vlad just remembered! Buluc keeps all his contacts and business information in a safe. Break into it and clean it out!"
"vld_fex_58b_03","There's a lot of money to be made from what's inside that safe."
"vld_fex_58_01","Do it already, take him down!"
"vld_fex_58_03","He's right there! Make him pay!"
"vld_fex_59a_01","Holy shit. They look pissed. No more drug money for the Tijuana Federales, yes?"
"vld_fex_59a_02","I would not expect the Federales to be so angry about one cartel boss. He must have paid them a LOT of money!"
"vld_fex_59a_03","Killing Buluc, you just took away the Federales' biggest money bag! They don't look too happy about it!"
"vld_fex_end_01","Once again, my friends, you have done me a good service. With Buluc now being shit out by fishes, I think the Coyopas are finished. And the Dentist has no more help in Mexico, so he will be desperate and vulnerable. Whatever job you have coming next should be easier for you. Just don't forget about Vlad, yes? There are a lot of things happening, things that could be dangerous for us in the future. But we will talk more... soon. Cheers and goodbye."
"vld_fex_end_02","You have done a good thing today, my friends. I think the Coyopas are now finished, and the Dentist will lose all his influence in Mexico. No help will now come to him from there. I will tell Hajrudin of this and he will be happy, maybe he will even straighten up a little. Maybe not. Now Vlad owes you one and I will repay very soon. Now, I have some new business to take care of. Until we speak again! Cheers and goodbye."
"vld_fex_intro_01_01","Locky, Locky, Locky!"
"vld_fex_intro_02_02","They have all those bunkers and shit.
"
"vld_fex_intro_02_03","What sense? ha? What fucking sense? You don't get the joke? OK, I'll tell you."
"vld_fex_intro_04_01a","Maybe you tell me what is going on with Bain and what you have planned next?
"
"vld_fex_tap01_01","Buluc is fucking paranoid crazy. Has cameras and microphones in every room, just like you said."
"vld_fex_tap02_01","Hey guys... listen to this."
"vld_fex_tap02_01b","Sure we do! Listen..."
"vld_fex_tap02_01c","Wait, wait. Listen to this..."
"vld_fex_tap02_01d","[phone rings]"
"vld_fex_tap02_02","Buluc, my old friend! How are you?"
"vld_fex_tap02_02a","Hey, guess who you piece of shit! How do you feel?"
"vld_fex_tap02_03","Oh, nothing special. I am just calling to pay my respects."
"vld_fex_tap03_01","Hello my friend."
"vld_fex_tap03_02","That shit you pulled with my relative. You're going to regret it."
"vld_fex_tap03_03a","I promised my wife I would make you pay. Don't you forget."
"vld_fex_tap04_02","Helloooo my old friend!"
"vld_fex_tap04_03a","Don't you worry about him. Worry about yourself instead."
"vld_fex_tap06_01","Tell me, old friend. How many years will you spend in purgatory, before going to hell?"
"vld_fex_tap06_01a","They say a man must spend time in Purgatory before going to hell."
"vld_fex_tap06_03a","Everything will become clear for you, like that Dead Head Vodka. "
"vld_fex_tap08_01","Hey, Locky... I am connected to Buluc's radio, yes?"
"vld_fex_tap08_02a","What's going on you donkey-fucker? Your old friend Vlad is sending you a present for the party!"
"vld_fex_tap08_03","In a few minutes, my friend, you will not be laughing so much, I think."
"vld_fex_tap08_03a","You wait, my friend! What is coming will not disappoint, I promise!"
"vld_fourstores_brf_speak_03b","I don't like this, and I like my money back. You go there and take it! And show them what goes for disloyal countrymen!"
"vld_fourstores_brf_speak_04b","I don't want store back. I want the money - and the show of strength. You go there and hit them hard! Money will come to you when you do."
"vld_fourstores_cnc_01","My friends! Can you help Vlad balance cash registers in old stores? Small thing really."
"vld_fourstores_debrief_01","I say good job! Hahaha! I will be using you men again! Ah! Vlad is on rise like a fucking Sputnik! Hoh! Now we party! Party Party! Hey!"
"vld_fourstores_debrief_02","Hahahey! I Say good job! Haha! I will be using you men again! Oh, yeah! Vlad is on rise like a fucking Sputnik! Hoh!"
"vld_fourstores_debrief_04","Don't! Don't mess with Vlad! They learn no messing! Thank you for making point for me, and money is for you to enjoy. I see you again!"
"vld_fourstores_debrief_05","Haha! I know you were men of steel. Thank you for setting the balance! Russians are now aware of Vlad again! Argh-hahaha! Like very angry bear, argh!"
"vld_ko1b_02_02","You found it. Good! Good. I knew I could depend on you."
"vld_ko1b_02_03","Yes. The vault! This is good. This is very good!"
"vld_ko1b_03_01","Ah, don't wet your knickers, Bain! I have buyer. Very far away. Is all good. "
"vld_ko1b_04_01","I got a train ready. Not too far away. Bring the warheads. Hurry!"
"vld_ko1b_04_03","I have a train waiting for them. It's close by. Bring the nukes. Hurry!"
"vld_ko1b_05_01","Feeling okay? Any rectal bleeding? Check poop holes."
"vld_ko1b_05_05","Feeling good? If your piss glows in the dark, consult a doctor."
"vld_ko1b_06_01","You see that muscle car? That's Gaddafi's 1965 original Longfellow. It's your ride now."
"vld_ko1b_06_03","Ah, over there! A Longfellow! 1965, 4.7 litre V8. You guys like to ride in style, right?"
"vld_ko1b_07_02","Is that Gaddafi's vintage 1965 muscle car? Can you think of a more perfect way to bring the nukes to me?"
"vld_ko1b_08_03","That's it. Ahhhhh, almost tempted. To see two suns in the sunset. Zavorazhivayushiy."
"vld_ko1b_09_01","Be careful with them. No intention to turn Washington into molten glass. Not today."
"vld_ko1b_09_02","Good, good. Keep bringing them. Be gentle with my little babushkas."
"vld_ko1b_end_01_02","Outstanding! Glad you got out of that one without setting the Eastern Seaboard on fire."
"vld_ko1b_end_01_03","Good work, my friends! Can't wait to see how those Murky bastards explain that one."
"vld_mallcrashers_brf_outro_01","It is war - and in war, we win!"
"vld_mallcrashers_brf_speak_01b","Well you will show him that is big mistake and I will make business with his competitors later. He will be example of other weak protectors. Go to the mall and hit it for everything. It must burn."
"vld_mallcrashers_cnc_03","Protection needs destruction to work. You will destroy their place, I will handle, how you say - marketing and "new business model"."
"vld_mallcrashers_debrief_02","Oh, haha. That was how you say: OVERKILL. I enjoyed it! Years in prison I dream of that! Money is yours - and you are worth it, friends."
"vld_moon_01_01","My friends, you will save my Christmas."
"vld_moon_02_01","A drunk Santa - it's a fucking abomination! And my coke!"
"vld_moon_02_02","If I lose this coke it's gonna fuck up my Christmas budget. Find it for me!"
"vld_moon_03_03","There can only be one shitfaced Santa guarded by cops in this mall. I hope."
"vld_moon_04_02","Smack that asshole so he wakes up!"
"vld_moon_04_03","I bet you've always wanted to punch that judgemental bastard Santa Claus! Now is your chance!"
"vld_moon_04_04","Smack that idiot from me!"
"vld_moon_05_01","Jewelry store! My favorite place!"
"vld_moon_05_03","Stones and coke. Beautiful!"
"vld_moon_09_02","Keypads, electronic magic. Ah you can do it!"
"vld_moon_09_03","The display is locked! See how tighly these assholes guard their treasures! Like dragon in stories!"
"vld_moon_10_01","Perfect! Now get the Jewelry box!"
"vld_moon_10_03","That's it! Now get the Jewels with the cocaine!"
"vld_moon_13_01","What the fuck. Cocaine in toys? It's brilliant! I have to remember this."
"vld_moon_14_01","What! Some shopper asshole is walking around with my cocaine! Find it!"
"vld_moon_14_03","Sold out? Fuck, someone just got a great deal on a pound of coke."
"vld_moon_15_02","Tin Boy is all coked up!"
"vld_moon_17_01","10? That's my size! And I don't mean shoes..."
"vld_moon_18_01","How hard can it be to find a fucking shoe box?"
"vld_moon_18_02","I miss the old Soviet shoes. Not so many stupid models to choose from!"
"vld_moon_19_01","Alright, it should be in the storage. Drill the fucking door."
"vld_moon_19_02","Drill that door open, find the shoes, get my cocaine!"
"vld_moon_21_01","There are too many fucking boxes here!"
"vld_moon_21_02","Where. Are. The. Shoes? Where?!"
"vld_moon_21_03","So where are they?!"
"vld_moon_22_03","Fucking boxes everywhere. It's like that video game..."
"vld_moon_23_02","VR. Very... enhanced... reality. What bullshit."
"vld_moon_23_03","Cocaine and VR - what an interesting mix."
"vld_moon_24_02","The VR set is virtually not here. Or should that be actually? I don't know - which is it?"
"vld_moon_24_03","VR - Vlad's Rejoicing. That's what this means to me."
"vld_moon_25_01","Ah a safe! How interesting!"
"vld_moon_25_03","I would have hid it in the safe too. But I'm a cynical man."
"vld_moon_26_01","I love opening Christmas presents!"
"vld_moon_26_03","Get the stuff, my friends!"
"vld_moon_27_01","I love a good wine with my borscht! Tasty!"
"vld_moon_28_01","Get that Red Red Resurrection or whatever it was called!"
"vld_moon_29_02","Watch for the helicopter. We're taking this stuff to the sky."
"vld_moon_29_03","Rescue from above is coming soon, my friends!"
"vld_moon_30_01","Now decorate the tree with these fine things!"
"vld_moon_30_02","Make the tree come alive, with snow!"
"vld_moon_31_01","Listen my friends... I've been thinking... that's a very nice Christmas tree. I think I'll take it. I will send the helicopter to pick it up."
"vld_moon_31_02","I want the tree. It shall fly into the sky like a big Christmas rocket! Hahaha!"
"vld_moon_31_03","That tree is very nice. We will steal it."
"vld_moon_32_01","Ladies and gentlemen, can you place some explosives please?"
"vld_moon_32_02","Listen...I need you to make me a big bang."
"vld_moon_34_02","Let's make like a tree and leave, my friends!"
"vld_moon_35_01","He'd better hold on tight. It'd be a shame if he fell out of the sky and died."
"vld_moon_36_01","Bile will be back soon. Hold on my friends!"
"vld_moon_36_02","Maybe do some shopping while you wait?"
"vld_moon_36_03","Just wait there, you'll be picked up soon. I promise!"
"vld_moon_37_03","This was fun, yes? But it's time to go!"
"vld_moon_38_04","I hope these fucking cops go home and reconsider their actions. They didn't treat Santa very well, so there will be no presents this year."
"vld_moon_38_06","They say you should work with family because you can trust them. But this guy, I can only trust him to be an idiot and to fuck up."
"vld_moon_38_09","They say always treat others like they treat you. And I've been treated very badly, many times."
"vld_moon_38_10","I bet these cops don't believe in Santa Claus. But I do! And he's a fucking pain in the ass!"
"vld_moon_39_01","Hey! Don't destroy the tree!"
"vld_moon_39_02","Leave the tree alone! I like it!"
"vld_moon_39_04","You can destroy anything you want, and kill anyone you want, but leave the tree alone!"
"vld_moon_39_05","Don't shoot the tree! You'll ruin Christmas!"
"vld_moon_39_06","Hey, I have plans for that tree! Don't destroy it!"
"vld_moon_39_08","Don't shoot the tree! It's an endangered species!"
"vld_moon_39_09","Don't shoot the Christmas tree!"
"vld_moon_cbf_01","My brother-in-law, that useless piece of trash, was transporting some snow for me - Colombian snow, you know, for Christmas. But he fucked up and was followed by the cops. He was hiding at the Midtown Mall, but I think the cops got him. Fucking American cops, there's no Christmas spirit in this country! I'm a friendly guy, and Christmas is about forgiving, but this is not ok. Not ok! You have to help me, my friends."
"vld_nightclub_brf_speak_01","This Tasteful Club was mine. After prison... No longer so. I know the owner and his ways. He's a useless (prick)."
"vld_nightclub_brf_speak_03b","Get the money and get out! Let them know Vlad started the party!"
"vld_nightclub_brf_speak_04b","This is in a neighbourhood with police. They don't like party crashing. "
"vld_nightclub_cnc_01","My old club needs visit. I know owner - he keeps money in safe somewhere. By now much money. Too much, is what I say."
"vld_nightclub_debrief_01","Very good party you had! Thank you! This will make others think twice next time."
"vld_nightclub_debrief_02","You party hard, hahaha! Like night in St. Petersburg. I have now more power and more hunger. We will take this town again."
"vld_nightclub_debrief_03","Hehe, ho-wow! You party like a real Russian. Mhm! Haha. Now spend money and come back to me when ready to take on bigger things. Yeah... Vlad is growing."
"vld_nightclub_debrief_04","Police was hurt and Tasteful is no longer party place. I like your style. Thank you for this and have fun with the money. I think we work together well."
"vld_pt1_01_02","Listen out for the goats. They'll be making...goat noises."
"vld_pt1_03_01","Boris, my driver, will come and pick you guys up."
"vld_pt1_03_03","I have a man on the way for you. Boris?"
"vld_pt1_04_03","Someone tried to take a goat. Make special pet, yeah? Like Igor the Serb and his "special" pets. "Special". Get into that apartment and rescue it."
"vld_pt1_05_01","Yes! Get in there, you hairy little bastard!"
"vld_pt1_05_02","And stay there, you little shit!"
"vld_pt1_05_03","And don't fucking move. Fucking goat prick..."
"vld_pt1_05_04","And stay...you grass-chewin', horn-growin', freaky-eyed MOTHERFUCKER!"
"vld_pt1_05_06","Another one. Good!"
"vld_pt1_05_07","Keep bringing goats!"
"vld_pt1_05_09","Stay! Heel! "
"vld_pt1_05_11","Don't run away again, little goat."
"vld_pt1_05_14","Don't move. Or I'll slow-fucking-roast you."
"vld_pt1_05_18","No more adventures for you, little friend."
"vld_pt1_cnc_01","I need you to break up a smuggling operation. Get the coke. There's just one small complication...."
"vld_pt1_cnc_02","Some fucks are trying to develop a coke operation in DC. Get their product. Break it up. Just one small detail..."
"vld_pt1_intro_02","Ah, my friends. So, the "mules", you see...well, they're actually goats. And they've..errr, escaped. Find them for me."
"vld_pt2_01_01","Fortunately, you have the criminal mind of Vlad on your side. I have an idea."
"vld_pt2_01_02","You think your Uncle Vlad would leave you there and not have support? Shame on you!"
"vld_pt2_03_02","Hey, we're missing some of the goats. This makes Vlad sad. Trust me, you want a happy Vlad."
"vld_pt2_03_03","Wait, some of the goats are missing. Why are some of the goats missing?!"
"vld_pt2_04_02","Well done, dear friends. I fucking love you all. Not as much as I love all of this coke, but still quite a lot!"
"vld_quote_set_a_01","I am a kind of person who you tell one thing and I remember that thing forever. I have a long memory - like a library."
"vld_quote_set_a_02","I come from small town, I own bakery. I make a living in honest way, most of time, so technically I am only part-time criminal."
"vld_quote_set_a_03","You know I just got out of prison. I like prison. Is invigorating for a man to beat another man to death with his hands, which I did not do, in case you want to know."
"vld_quote_set_a_03b","Why was I there? Why is any man in prison? Because someone, somewhere, fucked him over."
"vld_quote_set_a_04","I think best thing about America is laziness. People don't work hard here. There is no, how you say, work ethic."
"vld_quote_set_a_04b","In Russia people work much harder for much less. Much easier to make life here, if you don't mind getting little bit dirty."
"vld_quote_set_a_05","I prefer the company of dogs to people. Because dogs don't talk back, and they can't shoot for shit."
"vld_quote_set_a_06","I don't like vodka, but it likes me just fine."
"vld_ukranian_brf_intro_01","Friends..."
"vld_ukranian_brf_outro_01","Good luck, my friends. Vlad is appreciating you."
"vld_ukranian_brf_outro_02","Good luck, my friends. Vlad is appreciating you."
"vld_ukranian_brf_speak_02","Dmitri and slut bride are getting married. Instead of sending flowers, I have a better wedding gift for perfect princess: steal her fuckin' tiara..."
"vld_ukranian_debrief_02","You have earned payday. His bride was so furious she postpone wedding. Oh, poor, poor Dmitri. I cry many salty tears for him."
"wlf_pal_intro_02","Sorry to hear that, sir! We'll send our guys over right away!"
"xuk_chca_08_01","I recognize you! How many times have you traveled with us now?"
"xuk_chca_08_04","Is gambling at sea, not one of the best things in life?"
"xuk_chca_08_05"," You are all in for an enjoyable voyage, courtesy of Mr Wang."
"xuk_chca_09_01","Has everyone seen our new chandelier? An antique. I brought it in special from Hong Kong."
"xuk_chca_09_02","You westerners have it all wrong in so many things. Black cats are good luck, not bad!"
"xuk_chca_10_01","Get someone to clean up this mess. "
"xuk_chca_10_05","If Li Deng comes looking for me, tell him I am not to be disturbed!"
"xuk_chca_10_07","Did you hear what happened to the card-counter we caught last week? He was so ashamed that he threw himself overboard... tried to swim to the mainland!"
"xuk_chca_11_02","Why do these pathetic people keep asking me things?"
"xuk_chca_11_03","Do I look like a fucking waiter?"
"xuk_chca_12_01","Hey! What is going on?"
"xuk_chca_12_03","It's the Payday gang! Shoot them!"
"xuk_chca_12_05","You will not get off this ship alive, clowns!"
"xuk_chca_call_01_02","Yes, what is it?"
"xuk_chca_call_01_03","Yes?"
"xuk_chca_call_02_02","Hello again Mr Kozak. How are you feeling?"
"xuk_chca_call_03_03","I have no interest in children's tales."
"xuk_chca_call_03_04","No, but I would guess the dragon wins."
"xuk_chca_call_04_02","Is that so? Children are cruel."
"xuk_chca_call_04_04","Why is it, the dragon never wins?"
"xuk_chca_meeting_01_02","We have entered international waters. This trip will be profitable."
"xuk_chca_meeting_02_02","That would make us look weak."
"xuk_chca_meeting_02_05","I have taken care of it."
"xuk_chca_meeting_03_01","That was your responsibility!"
"xuk_chca_meeting_03_03","That was your fault, child!"
"xuk_chca_meeting_03_04","Do not lay that on me, woman child!"
"xuk_chca_meeting_04_03","You do not need to worry."
"xuk_chca_meeting_04_04","I understand Mountain Master. You may trust me, as always."
"xuk_chca_meeting_06_01","As you command, dai-lo."
"xuk_chca_meeting_06_03","As always, Mountain Master."
"xuk_chca_meeting_07_04","Good, I needed those."
"yuw_chca_01_01","What's Going on? Xun Kang?!"
"yuw_chca_02_01","You... Fuckers! I will drop you in a container at the bottom of the ocean!"
"yuw_pent_threat_04","Oh, now I understand. Someone has been whispering in your ear. After I've dealt with you, I'll do some house cleaning. Treachourous rats and vermin. No, no, not in my house.
 
You should have knelt at the foot of the mountain, begging for my forgiveness. But instead, you sided with dishonorable dogs. And that's how I will put you down, like rabid animals.
"
"yuw_sand_01_01a","My name is Yufu Wang. You don't know me."
"yuw_sand_01_01b","In the interest of saving us all a lot of trouble, I will give you an opportunity to return what you have taken and pay reparations to my organization."
"yuw_sand_01_01c","One, opportunity. No more."
"yuw_sand_01_02a","So, you got your man back. No matter, I've proven my point."
"yuw_sand_01_02b","You will return what you have taken from me, then send a message of sincere apology, and maybe our business will be done."
"zep_ca1_01_03","Getting some crosswind here. Nothing I can't handle."
"zep_ca1_01_04","City looks beautiful from up here."
"zep_ca1_01_05","Guys, I got half a dozen Japanese tourists shitting themselves in here. I hope they get good pics."
"zep_ca1_02_04","Almost at you, guys. We're gonna groove!"
"zep_ca1_03_01","Thank you. I see the fireworks. On our way!"
"zep_ca1_03_02","All right, there's the fireworks. Turning towards you."
"zep_ca1_03_03","I see your signal. Rock n' Roll! Here we come."
"zep_ca1_03_04","Those are some beautiful fireworks. We're coming."
"zep_ca1_04_01","This is Captain Ford of the Vegas Sky Express. Standing by for your signal."
"zep_ca1_05_05","Okay, your package is coming down. Sky Express will stay here 'til you're done. Good luck!"
